	abstract = {Synchrotron radiation (SR) sources based on single-pass accelerators (e.g. linacs, plasma accelerators) have to cope with electron beams with a rather complicated phase space distribution. In this case, the convolution method usually employed to calculate radiation properties can give poor accuracy or be not applicable at all. Moreover, dynamical effects can also play a role in the emission mechanism. This happens when the beam parameters (e.g. beam current) significantly change during the passage through the undulator. In this work, we present a dedicated SR module of the OCELOT toolkit [1,2], which is well suited to deal with these situations.},

The method is based on measurement of spectral intensity correlations in synchrotron radiation. Statistical properties of synchrotron radiation produced by a bunch passing the bending magnet are considered. The signal-to-noise ratio is analyzed in terms of the degeneracy parameter. The degeneracy parameter increases approximately as a third power of the wavelength which makes the visible range of synchrotron radiation to be a natural choice for the spectral intensity correlation measurement. An example of the experimental set-up is also described.},

Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. [Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002)]},

We show that there is a sufficient photon flux at the detector position. Our theoretical analysis includes an examination of the applicability of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem for the bending magnet radiation generated by an ultralow emittance electron beam and a detailed analysis of the imaging properties of rectangular pinhole cameras. This led us to practical, universal formulas. We identify the optimal aperture size and resolution of the camera in the given geometry. The theoretical findings are further substantiated by wavefront propagation numerical simulations of partially coherent radiation. This study serves both as a practical guide for optical engineering and an educational resource for explaining the imaging properties of pinhole cameras.},

Simulation of these phenomena is, therefore, critical in the design of new technologies for these and other such applications. For this reason, this tutorial describes how to generate random electromagnetic field instances or realizations consistent with a given or desired cross-spectral density matrix for use in wave optics simulations. This tutorial assumes that the reader has knowledge of the fundamental principles of statistical optics and optical coherence theory. An extensive reference list is provided where the necessary background information can be found. We begin this tutorial with a brief summary of the coherent-mode representation and the superposition rule of stochastic electromagnetic fields as these foundational ideas form the basis of all known synthesis techniques. We then present optical field expressions that apply these concepts before discussing proper sampling and discretization. We finally compare and contrast coherent-mode- and superposition-rule-based synthesis approaches, discussing the pros and cons of each. As an example, we simulate the synthesis and propagation of an electromagnetic partially coherent field from the literature. We compare simulated or sample statistics to theory to verify that we have successfully produced the desired field and are capturing its propagation behaviors. All computer programs, including detailed explanations of the source code, are provided with this tutorial. We conclude with a brief summary.},

Attempts to account for the modified spatial and angular profile of the undulator radiation in the presence of detuning due to energy spread, currently build on the simplified brightness expression derived under the assumption of Gaussian beams. The influence of energy spread on undulator radiation properties is becoming important in view of diffraction-limited rings with ultralow emittance coming on-line.

	abstract = {Interference effects are among the most fascinating optical phenomena For instance,
the butterflies and soap bubbles owe their beautiful colors to interference effects
They appear as a result of the superposition principle, valid in electrodynamics due
to the linearity of the wave equation If two waves interfere, the total radiation
field is a sum of these two fields and depends strongly on the relative phases between
these fields While the oscillation frequency of individual fields is typically too
large to be observed by a human eye or other detection systems, the phase differences
between these fields manifest themselves as relatively slowly varying field strength
modulations These modulations can be detected, provided the oscillating frequencies
of the superposed fields are similar As such, the interference provides a superb measure
of the phase differences of optical light, which may carry detailed information about
a source or a scattering object The ability of waves to interfere depends strongly
on the degree of correlation between these waves, ie their mutual coherence Until
the middle of the 20th century, the coherence of light available to experimentalists
was poor A significant effort had to be made to extend the degree of coherence, which
made the electromagnetic field determination using of the interference principle very
challenging Coherence is the defining feature of a laser, whose invention initiated
a revolutionary development of experimental techniques based on interference, such
as holography Important contributions to this development were also provided by astronomists,
as due to enormous intergalactic distances the radiation from stars has a high transverse
coherence length at earth With the construction of third generation synchrotron sources,
partially coherent X-ray sources have become feasible New areas of research utilizing
highly coherent X-ray beams have emerged, including X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
(XPCS), X-ray holography, and coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) In the former,
the dynamics of a system are explored whereas in the latter two predominantly static
real space images of the sample are obtained by phase retrieval techniques Using the
intense, coherent, and ultrashort X-ray pulses produced by so-called X-ray free-electron
lasers and energy recovery linacs these techniques promise new insights in structural
biology, condensed matter physics, magnetism and other correlated systems The key
feature of all these methods is the interference between the field scattered by different
parts of the sample under study As such, spatial coherence across the sample is essential
and understanding the coherence properties of the beams generated at new generation
X-ray sources is of vital importance for the scientific community This understanding
can even be used to improve the applied methods In this thesis we aim to describe
existing and develop new techniques to study transverse coherence properties of X-ray
beams at third and fourth generation sources},

	abstract = {New 4th-generation synchrotron sources, with their increased brilliance, promise to greatly improve the performances of coherent X-ray microscopy. This perspective is of major interest for crystal microscopy, which aims at revealing the 3D crystalline structure of matter at the nanoscale, an approach strongly limited by the available coherent flux. Our results, based on Bragg ptychography experiments performed at the first 4th-generation synchrotron source, demonstrate the possibility of retrieving a high-quality image of the crystalline sample, with unprecedented quality. Importantly, the larger available coherent flux produces datasets with enough information to overcome experimental limitations, such as strongly deteriorated scanning conditions. We show this achievement would not be possible with 3rd-generation sources, a limit that has inhibited the development of this otherwise powerful microscopy method, so far. Hence, the advent of next-generation synchrotron sources not only makes Bragg ptychography suitable for high throughput studies but also strongly relaxes the associated experimental constraints, making it compatible with a wider range of experimental set-ups at the new synchrotrons.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the coherence properties of the fourth-generation high-energy storage rings with emittance values of 10 pm rad is performed. It is presently expected that a storage ring with these low emittance values will reach diffraction limit at hard X-rays. Simulations of coherence properties were performed with the XRT software and an analytical approach for different photon energies from 500 eV to 50 keV. It was demonstrated that a minimum photon emittance (diffraction limit) reached at such storage rings is λ/2π. Using mode decomposition it is shown that, for the parameters of the storage ring considered in this work, the diffraction limit will be reached for soft X-ray energies of 500 eV. About ten modes will contribute to the radiation field at 12 keV photon energy and even more modes give a contribution at higher photon energies. Energy spread effects of the electron beam in a low-emittance storage ring were analysed in detail. Simulations were performed at different relative energy spread values from zero to 2 × 10−3. A decrease of the degree of coherence with an increase of the relative energy spread value was observed. This analysis shows that, to reach the diffraction limit for high photon energies, electron beam emittance should go down to 1 pm rad and below.},

The horizontal and vertical electron beam sizes are then retrieved by means of statistical optics approaches. The manuscript thoroughly describes the HNFS technique, and shows experimental results obtained at the ALBA Synchrotron Light Source. By changing the machine coupling, beam sizes as small as 5 μm are measured, thus improving on past measurements reported in the literature and proving the HNFS diagnostics suitable for low-emittance particle beams., This article appears in the following collection:},

Measurements of this intensity distribution at the MAX-IV low emittance storage ring are compared to theoretical predictions, and found to be in excellent agreement. This work shows upon the possibility of performing high resolution emittance diagnostics with visible or near-visible SR on upcoming low-emittance storage ring based light sources. As a byproduct of our study, we derive a closed analytical expression for the intensity distribution from a zero-emittance beam, in the limiting case of wide orbital collection angles.

 a single realisation of a stochastic process. This concept is most 
easily developed for estimating first and second moments of stationary

Ergodic and wide-sense stationary (WSS). The video first introduces 
ergodicity from an intuitive perspective, and then further expands the 
definition in terms of using the properties of a consistent estimator. 
This is expressed through the two definitions of ergodic in the mean, or
 ergodic in correlation. Examples of non-ergodic and ergodic processes 
are presented. One very detailed example proves a process is ergodic in 
the mean through calculating the bias and variance of the time-average.PGEE11164 Probability, Estimation Theory, and Random Signals Lectures -- School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh.

The text includes scalar, beam-like and general electromagnetic treatment of light. A brief statistical description of four fundamental experiments relating to random light: spatial and temporal field interference, intensity interferometry and phase conjugation, is also included in order to relate the analytical descriptions with practical observations.Rigorous mathematical methods for statistical manipulation of light sources useful for remote shaping of its various average properties, enhanced image resolution, optimized transmission in random media and for other applications are introduced. For illustration of efficient ways for manipulation of light polarization the generalized Stokes-Mueller calculus is applied for description of interaction of beam-like fields with classic and currently popular devices of polarization optics, including a spatial light modulator.Random light plays a special role in the image formation process. Three imaging modalities including the classic intensity-based system with structured source correlations, the polarization-based imaging system and the ghost interference approach are discussed in detail.Theoretical aspects of potential scattering of light from weakly scattering media are considered under a very broad range of assumptions: scalar/electromagnetic incident light, deterministic/random light/media, single/particulate media. Then, problems and methods in light characterization on interaction with extended, turbulent-like natural media, such as the Earth's atmosphere, oceans and soft bio-tissues that are currently widely used for communication, remote sensing and imaging purposes in these media, are provided.},

We further introduce fields that are cross-spectrally pure in either a global or local sense. Our analysis is based on an ideal field superposition realizable with all-reflective wavefront-shearing interferometers. Such devices avoid certain problems related to Young’s interferometer, which is the framework customarily employed in assessing cross-spectral purity. We show that any partially coherent beam can be transformed into a locally cross-spectrally pure beam whose cross-spectral density is specular. On the other hand, lack of space–frequency (and space–time) coupling ensures cross-spectral purity in the global sense, i.e.,\&\#x00A0;across an entire transverse plane, regardless of the spectral bandwidth or the temporal\&\#x00A0;shape of the pulses.},

The current analysis differs from the previous works on cross-spectral purity of nonstationary light beams such that the purity condition is in line with Mandel\&\#x2019;s original definition. In addition, in contrast to earlier works concerning the cross-spectral purity of the polarization-state Stokes parameters, intensity-normalized coherence Stokes parameters are applied. It is consequently found that in addition to separate spatial and temporal coherence factors the reduction formula contains a third factor that depends exclusively on polarization properties. We further show that cross-spectral purity implies a specific structure for electromagnetic spectral spatial correlations.

In general, for nonstationary cross-spectrally pure electromagnetic fields, the reduction formula of the two-time Stokes parameters normalized by the corresponding usual Stokes parameters is not similar to the one for stationary fields since the correlation properties for nonstationary fields depend on two-time instants t1 and t2, in addition to their time difference. Here, we derive a reduction formula by including time-integrated correlations that share a similar mathematical structure to that of reduction formulas used for stationary vector fields if the normalized spectra of the interfering fields are identical. Additionally, we examine the requirement of strict cross-spectral purity for nonstationary electromagnetic fields using a time-integrated coherence function, which exhibits a mathematical form similar to that of strict cross-spectral purity in stationary vector fields. This investigation sheds light on the cross-spectral purity of pulse-type fields, which holds potential applications in statistical optics.},

We show that in the electromagnetic case, assumptions similar to the scalar cross-spectral purity lead to a reduction formula, analogous with the one introduced by Mandel. We also derive a condition that shows that the absolute value of the normalized zeroth two-point Stokes parameter of two cross-spectrally pure electromagnetic fields is the same for every frequency component of the field. In analogy with the scalar theory we further introduce a measure of the cross-spectral purity of two electromagnetic fields, namely, the degree of electromagnetic cross-spectral purity.},

	abstract = {The development of cutting-edge materials crucially depends on the available instruments and technologies for its systematic study and analysis. One of the instruments that drive the progress is an X-ray microscope, a state-of-the-art machine that is “decoding the complexity of nature". The 4th generation synchrotron storage rings (SSR), which are also known as Diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSR), and X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL) are the best examples of such advanced microscopes. The investigation principle by such X-ray microscopes is based on applying advanced research methods and imaging techniques. The key requirements are the space and time resolution, high flux, and coherence of the probing X-ray beam that are provided by the 4th generation X-ray sources and XFELs. 
One of the most challenging tasks for the DLSRs and XFELs is photon diagnostics, namely, the precise determination of the photon source statistical parameters. The photon statistics of the 4th generation sources are notably different from that of their predecessors. Therefore, there is a significant demand for developing adequate and effective methods that correctly describe radiation properties from such ultimate facilities. An excellent approach and the analysis method, providing the information about the photon source, lies within the framework of statistical optics.  
The present thesis is focused on the extensive analysis of statistical properties of modern X-ray sources at large-scale facilities, such as the 4th generation high-energy storage ring PETRA IV, European XFEL (EuXFEL), and XFEL at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL-XFEL). Special attention is paid to the effects that may decrease coherence characteristics and impact source properties at these facilities.  
The present thesis is divided into two parts, where a comprehensive analysis of the coherence properties of the DLSR radiation is presented in the first part. Attention is paid to the optics effects on the photon beam transported through the beamline, electron beam energy spread effects on coherence and brightness of a DLSR photon source, and resonant energy detuning effects. A method in the framework of statistical optics is proposed as an adequate approach for the characterization of photon beam properties at DLSR facilities. The analysis is backed up with semi-analytical simulations based on the proposed model. 
The second part of the thesis is devoted to photon source diagnostics and the precise determination of the statistical parameters at high-energy XFEL facilities. Results of experiments performed at EuXFEL and PAL-XFEL are discussed in this part of the thesis. The method within the framework of statistical optics for the EuXFEL photon beam characterization is described, where special attention was paid to the monochromator resolution and the interplay between the resolution and the size of the exit slits of the monochromator. The method was applied to three different regimes of the XFEL operation and was checked with simple analytical simulations. The influence of the energy chirp effect on the analysis results was considered as well. Further, the photon source diagnostics is presented for the PAL-XFEL facility, operating in the Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) regime with the wide bandwidth beam and filtered monochromatic beam, as well as in the regime of Self-Seeding (SS) with highly intense radiation.},

	abstract = {Most often, noise is encountered in a negative context and is considered something that needs to be minimized. However, there are multiple examples where noise is used as a non-invasive probe into the parameters of a certain system, and even to measure fundamental constants. In this paper we describe two experiments, which were carried out to study the statistical properties of undulator radiation in the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab. The first experiment studied the turn-to-turn fluctuations in the power of the radiation generated by an electron bunch. The magnitude of these fluctuations depends on the 6D phase-space distribution of the electron bunch. In IOTA, we demonstrated that this effect can be used to measure some electron bunch parameters, small transverse emittances in particular. In the second experiment, a single electron was stored in the ring, emitting a photon only once per several hundred turns. In this regime, any classical interference-related collective effects were eliminated, and the quantum fluctuations could be studied in detail to search for possible deviations from the expected Poissonian photon statistics. In addition, the photocount arrival times were used to track the longitudinal motion of a single electron and to compare it with simulations. This allowed us to determine several dynamical parameters of the storage ring such as the rf cavity phase jitter and the dependence of the synchrotron motion period on amplitude.},

	abstract = {Diese Arbeit befasst sich hauptsächlich mit zwei Themen aus dem Gebiet der kohärenten magnetischen Röntgenstreuung. Der erste Themenbereich beschäftigt sich mit der Ermittlung der räumlichen Kohärenzeigenschaften von Synchrotronstrahlung im weichen Röntgenbereich mit Hilfe von magnetischen Specklebildern. Dafür wurde ein resonantes magnetisches Röntgenstreuexperiment an der L3 Absorptionskante von Kobalt unter der Verwendung von Co/Pt Multilagenfilmen und CoPd Legierungsfilmen durchgeführt. Die erhaltenen magnetischen Specklebilder entstehen dabei durch Streuung an magnetischen Domänenstrukturen infolge des Röntgenzirkulardichroismus. In der Arbeit wird eine Methode vorgestellt, die auf der Analyse der Fouriertransformation von magnetischen Specklebildern basiert und einen Zugang zur zweidimensionalen Darstellung der gegenseitigen Kohärenzfunktion verschafft. Dabei wird ausgenutzt, dass die Autokorrelationsfunktion von ungeordneten labyrinthartigen magnetischen Domänenstrukturen perfekt plane Flanken aufweist. Die Methode erlaubt die gleichzeitige Ermittlung der transversalen Kohärenzlänge in allen radialen Richtungen des einfallenden Strahls. 
Der zweite Themenbereich befasst sich mit der Untersuchung und Charakterisierung von labyrinthartigen magnetischen Domänenstrukturen von Co/Pd Multilagenkeilen in Abhängigkeit der Kobaltdicke nahe bei und innerhalb des Spinreorientierungsübergangs. Resonante magnetische Röntgenstreuung wird benutzt um die durch die Schichtdickenänderung hervorgerufene Veränderung der magnetischen Mikrostruktur zu untersuchen. Die aus den CCD Bildern extrahierten radialen Streuintensitätsprofile der magnetischen Domänenstrukturen zeigen Veränderungen der Peak-position, Breite und Intensität als Funktion der Kobaltschichtdicke. Um dieses Verhalten zu erklären wird ein Model vorgestellt, welches eine Beschreibung von ungeordneten labyrinthartigen magnetischen Domänenstrukturen ermöglicht. Das Model basiert auf synthetischen eindimensionalen Domänenstrukturen mit gammaverteilten Domänengrößen um signifikante Domänengrößenvariationen mit einzuschließen. Beschrieben wird das Model durch die mittlere Domänengröße, der Domänenwandbreite und dem Formparameter der Verteilungsfunktion, wobei gezeigt wird, dass dieser charakteristisch für eine bestimmte Domänenstrukturgeometrie ist. Als Anwendungsfall für das Model werden die Ergebnisse genutzt um schichtdickenabhängige Anisotropien der Co/Pd Multilagenkeile zu bestimmen.},

The IPAC algorithm can be used with different popular transforms, such as the Fourier transform, Stransform, and continuous wavelet transforms. The targets for the simulation are the marginal probability distribution function of the process and the power spectral density function of the process that is defined based on the variables in the transform domain for the adopted transform.

	abstract = {Several methodologies utilize translation vector process theory for simulation of non-Gaussian stochastic vector processes and fields. However, translation theory imposes certain compatibility conditions on the non-Gaussian cross-spectral density matrix (CSDM) and the non-Gaussian marginal probability density functions (PDFs). For many practical applications such as simulation of wind velocity time histories, the non-Gaussian CSDM and PDFs are assigned arbitrarily. As a result, they are often incompatible. The generally accepted approach to addressing this incompatibility is to approximate the incompatible pair of CSDM/PDFs with a compatible pair that closely matches the incompatible pair. A limited number of techniques are available to do so and these methodologies are usually complicated and time consuming. In this paper, a novel iterative methodology is presented that simply and efficiently estimates a non-Gaussian CSDM that: (a) is compatible with the prescribed non-Gaussian PDFs and (b) closely approximates the prescribed incompatible non-Gaussian CSDM. The corresponding underlying Gaussian CSDM is also determined and used for simulation purposes. Numerical examples are provided demonstrating the capabilities of the methodology for both general non-Gaussian stochastic vector processes and a non-Gaussian vector wind velocity process.},

Many physical sources, both primary and secondary ones, are adequately approximated by this model. Coherence and radiometric properties of light generated by such sources (assumed, for simplicity, to be planar) are discussed and an important reciprocity relation is shown to exist between light in the far zone and in the source plane. This relation implies that the degree of coherence in the far zone is given by the classic form of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, even though the source may have a high degree of spatial coherence over arbitrarily large areas. The reciprocity relation also provides a generalization of a recently derived result that expresses the angular dependence of the radiant intensity in terms of the degree of spatial coherence of light in the source plane. The dependence of all the basic radiometric quantities on the distribution of the optical intensity across the source and on the degree of spatial coherence of the light emerging from the source is discussed and is illustrated, for some typical sources, by computed curves.},

This distribution is compared with the phase distribution of radiation emitted by a point source, being at rest in the laboratory frame. Strictly speaking, the SR phase distribution over the entire area cannot precisely coincide with that of an immobile point source. Nevertheless, the carried-out calculations showed that they practically coincide within a rather large entrance window area. The theoretical results obtained will allow to accurately describe the SR wave properties. In particular, they may find applications in the SR diagnostics.},

	abstract = {An electron beam passing through a tube of small inner diameter which is lined on the inside with a dielectric layer will radiate energy in the THz range due to the interaction with the boundary. The resonant enhancement of certain frequencies is conditioned by structure parameters such as tube radius and the permittivity and thickness of the dielectric layer. In low-loss structures narrow-band radiation is generated which can be coupled out by suitable antennas. For higher frequencies, the coupling to the resistive outer metal layer becomes increasingly important. The losses in the outer layer prohibit reaching higher frequencies with narrow-band conditions. Instead, short broad-band pulses can be generated with still attractive power levels. In the first section of the paper, a general theory of the impedance of a two-layer structure is presented and the coupling to the outer resistive layer is discussed. Approximate relations for the radiated energy, power and pulse length for a set of structure parameters are derived and compared with numerical results in the following section. Finally, the first numerical result of the out-coupling of the radiation by means of a Vlasov antenna and estimates of the achieved beam quality are presented.},

SWFA aims to raise the gradient beyond the limits of conventional radiofrequency (RF) accelerator technology, and thus the RF to beam energy efficiency, by reducing RF breakdowns from confining the microwave energy in a short (on the order of about 10 ns) and intense pulse excited by a drive beam. We envision that the following research topics, within the scope of AF7, are of great interest in the next decade: advanced wakefield structures, terahertz and sub-terahertz (THz) structures, and RF breakdown physics. Research on SWFA in the above directions would directly contribute to long-term large-scale applications, including AAC-based linear colliders and compact light sources. There is also potentially a strong synergy between SWFA and other AAC concepts, when structures are combined with plasmas into hybrid AAC schemes. Research on novel structures is at the core of advancing SWFA, and is critical to future AAC-based linear colliders; at the same, it has a strong synergy with other directions, such as cavity designs, high-power microwave systems and sources, and compact light sources.},

	title = {Wavefront aberrations of high numerical aperture {X}-ray optics},
	abstract = {The achievable resolution in hard X-ray microscopy is limited by inherent lensaberrations, which makes the characterization of wavefront aberrations a criticaltask for pushing the limits of microscopy. The main goal of this thesis is to developand employ techniques to test state-of-the-art X-ray optics. Measuring the wavefront(the phase profile of the beam after being deflected by the optic) is no trivial task asdetectors can only record the intensity, but not the phase. This phase informationcan be retrieved by different techniques, such as direct phase measurements (e.g.interferometry), propagation based methods or phase gradient measurements. Herewe mainly employ the phase gradient measurement technique ptychographic X-rayspeckle tracking (PXST), which was developed in-house at DESY (Germany). InPXST, angular deviations of the ray paths are measured with nanoradian precisionby tracking the relative positions of speckles (or, indeed, any feature) in projectionholograms, which are recorded as a sample is scanned across the wavefront. Withthe capability of performing wavefront metrology, this thesis furthermore aims toinvestigate the origin of the aberrations and to develop methods to correct them.The aberration studies were performed on multilayer Laue lenses (MLLs), which arediffractive optical elements that show the potential to tremendously advance thefield of hard X-ray microscopy as they can attain high diffraction efficiency ({\textgreater} 60 \%)and enable high resolution (sub-10 nm) imaging. Just as for any diffractive lens,the achievable resolution of an MLL is determined by the smallest structure period.MLLs are made by layer deposition techniques that support the fabrication of lenseswith 1 nm resolution or better. Moreover, the layers of MLLs are tilted respect to theincident beam in order to satisfy the Bragg condition for usable diffraction efficiency.In order to obtain a better understanding of the optical properties of MLLs, differentlens designs were simulated with the multislicing method. In this method an incidentscalar wave (X-rays) is being numerically propagated through an object (MLL), whichis modelled by a set of thin slices.During this PhD thesis several experiments were performed at large scale facilitiessuch as synchrotrons (ESRF, PETRA III, NSLS II) and European X-ray Free ElectronLaser. In these experiments wavefront aberrations of wedged MLLs were measuredprimarily with the PXST method. In addition, different imaging modalities wereexplored.Access to synchrotrons is limited and beamtimes are typically months apart. On theother hand the development of X-ray optics relies on quick and reliable feedback.This is why part of this PhD thesis was also dedicated to setup, commission and test alab-based X-ray facility. This facility utilizes a bright microfocus X-ray source and hasfull capability for PXST measurements. Especially in the later part of this PhD thesisthis facility was used extensively for wavefront characterization of MLLs. Moreover,measurements of the diffraction efficiency of multilayer Laue gratings were realizedwith this instrument, confirming the theoretically predicted performance.Measuring the wavefront aberrations of MLLs from successive depositions allowed usto verify a model of the systematic zone placement errors in MLLs and to iterativelycorrect for aberrations by modifying the deposition parameters. This approachreduced wavefront aberrations by a factor of 120 as compared to MLLs employed inprevious experiments. The deposition-corrected MLLs were used for imaging in anexperiment at NSLS-II and they focused X-rays to 4.1 nm × 4.0 nm (horizontal ×vertical), which is a record (the smallest) focus size for X-rays. Scanning transmissionX-ray microscopy (STXM) images of a high-resolution Siemens star test patterndemonstrated a sub-10 nm imaging resolution along the vertical direction.Furthermore, the possibility to correct aberrations with a refractive corrector (phaseplate) was demonstrated for metal-based and polymer-based phase plates. Forthe latter case, a reduction of the root mean square aberrations by 32 \% wasdemonstrated, which is in agreement with the expected effect of the phase plate. Inorder to enable the compensation of larger wavefront aberrations without reducingthe effective aperture size due to the phase plate’s attenuation, the concept ofa compound refractive corrector (CRC) is proposed and a user-friendly softwarewas developed to generate 3D models that are printable with a commercial two-photon photopolymerization system. In a first experimental study on CRCs, an 81 \%reduction of the root mean square wavefront aberrations was demonstrated.The systematic studies on wavefront characterization (e.g. via PXST) validated thatthe wavefront measurements are correct and reproducible. Commissioning andtesting the PXST method in a lab-based X-ray facility enabled us to systematicallydevelop phase plates and corrected X-ray optics (e.g. MLLs). With continuing workin this direction focusing hard X-rays to 1 nm spot sizes is now within reach},

	title = {Studies on {Experiments} and {Free}-{Electron} laser concepts with a {Transverse} {Gradient} {Undulator}},
	abstract = {Free-electron lasers (FELs) are the fourth generation of synchrotron light sources operating in the ultraviolet and X-ray wavelength range. The large size and the high costs of such sources limit the handiness of them. Emerging new acceleration techniques in the recent years, opened the way to design more compact accelerators. Due to generation of high energy electron beams in a very short distance with a high peak current, laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) are regarded as capable candidates for deriving FELs. The major problem with these types of accelerators is the relatively large energy distribution of the electrons within the beam. Such a large energy spread will hinder the FEL performance resulting in a reduction of the gain and the power. In this purpose, modified undulator schemes, so-called transverse gradient undulators (TGUs), were proposed. In this dissertation, the concept of a transverse gradient undulator is studied in detail. The concept relies on fulfilling the resonance condition for different particles’ energy within the beam. The resonance condition can be satisfied for all particles with different energies if the positions and the energies of the particles are related to the magnetic field gradient of the TGU. This can be done by introducing dispersion, which is matched to the TGU gradient. The first superconducting cylindrical TGU with 40 periods (TGU40) was built at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and it was originally planned to perform an experiment with the ARES linac at SINBAD facility at DESY in order to test its capability in compensation of the energy spread. The detailed setup of the experiment with the simulation results are presented. Moreover, the TGU scheme is investigated from an FEL point of view. After a successful test of the prototype TGU40, the first demonstration of an FEL lasing experiment with a TGU and a laser-plasma accelerator as the beam generator should be performed. In this regard, a scaling study is presented in order to determine the minimum beam requirement for achieving FEL power. The scaling is done over a possible range of the LPA parameters which can be reached by the current technology and an optimized LPA setup. In addition to the mentioned above studies, a compact beam line transport to deliver LPA beam to the TGU is designed and the effect of the beam line and the collective effects like space-charge and coherent synchrotron radiation on the beam properties are investigated. This comprehensive study opens the way of demonstrating the possible lab-scale free-electron laser experiment with a laser-plasma accelerator},

	title = {Coherent femtosecond pulse shaping towards the short wavelength regime},
	abstract = {Since the advent of the first camera, flashes of light have been an integral tool in observing the world around us. Following the creation of the laser, these flashes of light have been getting temporally shorter and shorter, allowing faster and faster phenomena to be observed. Now these pulses can be as short as femtoseconds, or even a few attoseconds. Control over these short pulses also can allow observation and enable control over dynamics in matter. In the present thesis the complete characterisation of an all-reflective 4f pulse shaper is presented. A periodic spectral amplitude modulation is applied to a femtosecond Deep-UltraViolet (DUV) pulse within an open-loop shaping control scheme. The DUV pulse is produced via nonlinear frequency up-conversion from a fundamental infrared pulse. The pulses before and after this device are fully characterised in time, frequency and chirp. Transmission of the device in the DUV is also measured and data is given. Due to the all-reflective nature of the device it is capable of operating with coherent pulses at short wavelengths, such as pulses produced from a seeded free-electron laser via High-Gain Harmonic Generation (HGHG). The coherent pulses produced this way via seeding use the same DUV laser as is used to operate the pulse shaper and are generated as harmonics of the seed. The diffraction gratings in the shaper are designed such that harmonics of the seed laser follow the beampath of the DUV pulse through the pulse shaper, minimising the need for realignment. The coherent extreme-ultraviolet pulses produced from the seeded free-electron laser operating in HGHG are characterised in time and frequency by terahertz streaking. Chirp is applied to the ultraviolet seed pulse and the effect upon the output seeded free-electron laser pulse is explored with temporal pulse characterisation methods. Control over pulse shaping in the DUV and towards soft x-rays is interesting for applications such as coherent control, where dynamical processes in matter are controlled by coherent light fields},

	title = {{3D} nano-tomography using coherent {X}-rays},
	abstract = {X-rays allow to non-destructively investigate biological, chemical or physical processes at the nano-scale. Their high penetration depth in matter allows to investigate samples even inside sample environments, which would be difficult with complementary methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microscopy technique ptychography has been established in X-ray imaging in recent years. Utilizing the short wavelengths of X-rays, resolutions of about 10 nm and below have been achieved in the reconstructed projection images.However, projections provide no information about the spatial distribution of features along the beam axis. Knowing the structure of materials and objects in three spatial dimensions is key to understanding their properties and function. Hence, two-dimensional ptychography has been extended to three spatial dimensions based on tomographic methods known from radiographs and computed tomography (CT) resulting in a method called ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PXCT). Using PXCT quantitative three-dimensional maps of the complex index of refraction of the sample can be reconstructed, which yield quantitative information on the local electron density. Such PXCT measurements are very time intensive to perform, very computing intensive to reconstruct and are based on several limiting approximations.In this work, a detailed description of PXCT and its limitations is given. From that starting point, a coupled ptychographic tomography (CPT) algorithm, improving on the PXCT algorithm in terms of alignment and sampling requirements, is presented and tested on experimental data. Moreover, a resonant PXCT experiment is performed at the Ga-K absorption edge, allowing for additional elemental and chemical information inside the reconstructed volume. Afterwards, the shared limit of both the PXCT algorithm and the CPT algorithm, the thin-sample approximation, is addressed by presenting a multi-slice approach utilizing the propagation of the X-ray beam in the sample. In total three different experiments, performed at the hard X-ray nanoprobe endstation at beamline P06 at the PETRA III synchrotron radiation source, are presented in this work},

	abstract = {A plasma can sustain electric fields orders of magnitude larger than those attainable with the conventional radio-frequency (RF) technology typically used in particle accelerators, which are limited to ∼ 100 MV/m due to electrical breakdowns occurring at the metallic boundary of the accelerating structures. In a particle-beam-driven plasma-wakefield accelerator (PWFA), a charge-density wake sustaining field gradients in excess of GV/m is driven by the passage of a relativistic high-intensity particle bunch through a plasma. By harnessing the gradientsof the wake, particles trailing behind the wakefield-driving bunch can be accelerated to GeV energies over meter distances, thus enabling a drastic reduction of the size of acceleratorcomponenents and, consequently, potentially reducing the costs of future accelerator facilities. Despite this promise, however, for PWFA to be a viable technology, the quality of theaccelerated bunches must match that achieved by RF-based state-of-the-art FEL linacs and particle colliders. Even though theoretical predictions suggest that PWFA schemes are capable of producing electric-field profiles with properties sufficient to preserve the longitudinal-phase-space structure of the accelerating beam, direct experimental demonstration has not yet been achieved.In the work presented in this thesis the diagnostic capabilities of a novel X-band transverse deflection structure (TDS)—featuring femtosecond resolution and a variablepolarisation of the streaking field—are exploited to investigate two mechanisms enabling the preservation of the energy spread of electron beams accelerated in a nonlinear plasma wake: optimal beam loading to preserve the correlated energy spread and a fully evacuated ion column to preserve the uncorrelated energy spread. By directly observing the longitudinal phase space of 1-GeV bunches accelerated 44 MeV in a nonlinear plasma wake, experiments performed at the FLASHForward facility (DESY, Hamburg) demonstrate that the longitudinal accelerating gradients are transversely homogeneous to within 0.8 \% (1.5 \%) at an interval of confidence of 68 \% (95 \%) and show variable amounts of beam loading depending on the exact shape of the current profile of the driver-trailing-bunch pair. The results presented in this work experimentally demonstrate the predicted suitability of PWFA for future applications requiring the preservation of high longitudinal beam quality. Furthermore, a reconstruction of the beam-plasma interaction in a particle-in-cell code has been accomplished, which illustrates the extreme sensitivity of the PWFA acceleration process to the phase-space distribution of the incoming beams. These achievements suggest that, while PWFA is capable of producing the desired field geometries, an improved control over the production of driver-trailing-bunch pairs will be required to demonstrate stable and quality-preserving acceleration at higher energy gains},

	title = {Novel seeding techniques for generation of high repetition rate coherent nanometer {FEL} radiation},
	abstract = {igh gain free electron lasers (FELs) generate radiation of unprecedented brightness and unique properties and have proven to be a useful tool for applications in a wide range of studies in physics, biology, medicine and chemistry. External seeding techniques have been experimentally demonstrated and aim to improve the intrinsically poor temporal coherence of a high-gain FEL starting from shot noise. Seeded schemes, like the high gain harmonic generation (HGHG), are based on frequency up-conversion and generate fully coherent radiation thanks to the external seed laser that initiates the process in the FEL. However, the dependence of the properties of the seeded radiation on those of the seed laser is at the same time a limiting factor. The repetition rate of the state-of-the-art seed lasers used in external seeding is incompatible with the repetition rates of modern high-gain FELs based on superconducting technology. In addition, seeded radiation is a harmonic of the seed laser wavelength, a feature that limits the output wavelength to above a few nanometers and restricts its tunability. To overcome these limitations it is necessary to search for new possibilities in FELs.The scope of this cumulative thesis is to introduce novel ideas that allow us to achieve high repetition rate and fully coherent radiation at an extended and tunable wavelength range. The three proposals of this thesis aim to reduce the dependence of external seeding schemes on the seed laser source and at the same time, maintain the full coherence of seeded radiation. The first proposal is an optical klystron-based HGHG, which modifies the conventional HGHG beamline in a way that relaxes the stringent requirements on the seed laser power by several orders of magnitude. This way, the repetition rate of the seed laser source can be increased, or seed laser sources of shorter wavelengths can be used instead. The second proposal is an HGHG seeded oscillator-amplifier setup: an optical cavity captures a conventional low repetition rate seed laser pulse and stores it to seed electron bunches at a high repetition rate. The third proposal is an HGHG oscillator-amplifier that eliminates the dependence on external seed lasers. Instead of the external laser, the electrons generate the light pulse themselves, starting from shot noise, and the radiation is stored in the optical cavity to seed electron bunches at high repetition rates. In addition to the high repetition rate, this scheme allows shorter and tunable seeded radiation. This type of radiation has never been possible in the past and can greatly benefit already existing experiments and support new experiments and more discoveries by accelerating the ongoing science at FELs},

	abstract = {The goal of this dissertation was to investigate a reliable single-shot pulse duration diagnostic tool for the pulse duration and wavelength range delivered at the Free Electron LAser of Hamburg (FLASH). At Self-Amplified-Spontaneous-Emission-based free-electron lasers (FELs), the radiation parameters - duration, arrival time, energy, spectrum, and spatial distribution - differ for each pulse. A dedicated single-shot diagnostic tool for each parameter is therefore essential in order to interpret the experimental data on a pulse-to-pulse basis.This work summarizes the effort to realize a temporal diagnostic tool using the streaking technique by building a terahertz (THz) "streak camera". The setup was prepared and calibrated, and various pulse duration measurements with different experimental settings were performed in order to explore and validate the application range of the streaking method. The aspects limiting the temporal resolution using the commissioned streaking setup were characterized experimentally. The pulse duration measurements were analyzed using classical and quantum mechanical streaking theory models.Furthermore, a deep statistical study on the SASE fluctuations was realized using single-shot measurements of various radiation parameters. Scaling laws were derived using theoretical simulations and the measured data. This analysis enabled the intrinsic statistical SASE fluctuations to be disentangled from accelerator-based fluctuations and measurement uncertainties},

	isbn = {9789180393157},
	abstract = {In recent decades, laser systems emitting pulses of light containing only a few electric field oscillations under their envelope have become common in many ultrafast optics laboratories. Owing to unique temporal characteristics and achieving extreme field strengths, these so-­called few­-cycle pulses have been instrumental in unlocking new regimes of light-­matter interaction.The work presented in this thesis is focused on mastering the techniques to generate and characterize few­-optical-­cycle light pulses in the near­ and short-wave infrared spectral regions. Two systems based on optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) are presented. Derived from the same laser front-end, they both deliver sub­-2.5-­cycle pulses at high repetition rate (200 kHz) with a stable electric field waveform. The first laser source is a near-­infrared OPCPA delivering 6 fs pulses at a carrier of 850 nm which was upgraded during this thesis. The upgrade resulted in a boost of the output pulse energy from 8 μJ to 15 μJ without loss in pulse quality. The second laser source is a few­cycle OPCPA around 2 μm, emitting {\textless}16 fs pulses with 13 μJ of pulse energy, which was developed entirely during the thesis. We tested the capabilities of this system by driving high-­order harmonic generation (HHG) in argon gas.As a promising alternative route for few­-cycle pulses, nonlinear pulse post­compression based on multipass cells (MPCs) was investigated. It is an efficient way of reducing the pulse duration of high­-power Ytterbium (Yb) lasers. In this thesis, two MPC­-based compression experiments are presented. Firstly, 1.2 ps pulses from a mJ­-level Yb amplifier were compressed to 13 fs with two consecutive gas­-flled MPCs. Secondly, the output of another Yb amplifier was compressed from 300 to 31 fs using a bulk MPC while preserving high beam quality.Successful development of such systems is impossible without careful characterization of the output pulses. Throughout the thesis, we relied on the extensive use of the dispersion scan (d­-scan) pulse characterization technique. We demonstrate the powerful capabilities and versatility of the second­harmonic d­-scan by measuring pulses of diﬀerent durations and central wavelengths in scanning and single­-shot configurations.Lastly, the few-­cycle light pulses were applied to two-­color photoionization experiments and the study of lightwave-­driven currents in semiconductors at high repetition rates},

	title = {Analysis of single particle imaging experiments at {X}-ray {Free}-{Electron} {Lasers}},
	abstract = {Single particle imaging (SPI) is a novel technique in X-ray science aimed at reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of nanoscale objects. Studying the inner structure of biological particles has become increasingly crucial, as evidenced by the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showing the necessity of scientific development in this field. The main advantage of this approach is that atomic structures can be resolved in their native environment without crystallization.SPI experiments require using electromagnetic radiation with a sub-nanometer wavelength (such as X-rays) sufficient to resolve the object’s internal structure. Because of the weak interaction of X-rays with matter, high coherence and photon flux are required to resolve the finest features in the object. Due to the extreme radiation dose, the biological particles are destroyed in the scattering process. To record a diffraction pattern corresponding to the undamaged structure, the X-ray pulse must have a duration shorter than the typical timescale of the destruction process. Therefore, high-brilliance synchrotron light sources could not be used due to insufficient coherent flux in a single pulse that is required for recording enough signal. The development of X-ray sources that have a high intensity and short pulse duration – X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) – overcome this challenge.In the SPI method, many identical particles of the investigated system are injected into the X-ray beam providing diffraction images in random orientations. The three-dimensional structure of the object is obtained by applying complex algorithms to the collected diffraction patterns. The size of one such dataset could exceed terabytes; this motivates the development and implementation of elaborate data analysis techniques that help to save expensive XFEL time and speed up data processing.The first two parts of this Thesis are based on the methodological development of the SPI data analysis workflow. The experimental data was collected from the virus PR772 at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC, Stanford, USA in the frame of the SPI consortium. As a result of the developed methodology, which includes machine learning object classification, a three-dimensional virus structure with a resolution below 10 nanometers was reconstructed. The comparison of the result with the cryogenic microscopy studies showed similar features and an overall agreement between both techniques. Due to the complexity and cost of the SPI experiments, the preparation is a time- and effort-consuming process that requires high-level planning. The third part of this Thesis explores the optimization of set-up parameters through the simulation of the SPI experiment with tick-borne encephalitis virus. These simulations contributed to the success of an actual experiment performed at the European XFEL in Hamburg, Germany},

	abstract = {Emerging high power THz sources pave the road for THz-driven manipulation and acceleration of ultra-shortelectron bunches, opening a path to an order of magnitude higher accelerating gradients than conventional radiofrequency (RF)-driven structures. In this thesis, THz waveguides are studied with theoretical methods that were established in the field of RFengineering for the characterization of accelerating devices. The performance of a proof-of-principle, novel electrongun, that is powered by two single-cycle 50 µJ THz pulses, is simulated, including detailed mechanical and materialparameters. The results predict an unavoidable reduction in peak field, for the present case study by 30 \%. The concept is extended to multiple layers to distribute the energy along the beam axis for efficient acceleration, relying on a simplified numerical model developed in this thesis. The model is applied in a case study which assumes two100 µJ single-cycle pulses as drivers. Behind the electron gun, the electrons will be accelerated in a THz linear accelerator (linac) which is implemented as dielectric loaded waveguide (DLW). The ideal permittivity with respect to the gradient-to-pulse-energy ratio is derived from a theoretical point of view and is discussed in detail. A constant gradient structure (CG) is designed that leverages waveguide attenuation and shunt impedance due to ohmic and dielectric loss. It is shown that CGs require less THz energy than their longitudinally homogeneous counter-parts and is an important solution for improvement in THz accelerator efficiency. A free-space collinear coupling via horn antennas is considered for injecting THz power into the structures. The coupling was studied semi-analytically and numerically, showing that it is less efficient to the accelerating mode(83 \%) than to the fundamental mode (93 \%). A novel, non-resonant waveguide-to-waveguide coupling scheme has been designed in this thesis which decreases the coupling losses to the accelerating mode from 17 \% to 11 \%. The proposed bend mode converter is not only more efficient, but also at least a factor of 10 more compact along the beam axis. The thesis describes two experiments, that are designed to measure dielectric parameters and dispersion relations in waveguides. The first one is necessitated to test the dielectric to be used in future beam-based experiments, resolving observed variations of the permittivity in literature. The second setup determines the frequency at which the fundamental mode interacts synchronously with a particle bunch, and enables mechanical tuning. It is shown that, for the device under test, the matching phase velocity is achieved at 287 GHz by varying the dielectric layer thickness. Finally, the various findings on the efficiency of a THz accelerator are combined with results in literature to propose an optimized THz transport setup. In comparison to a reference layout which is often applied in this or similar form in the literature, this novel scheme reduces the requirement on the generated THz energy by a factor of three for the same accelerating voltage. It is envisaged that future dedicated experiments and facilities may profit from the here proposed, efficient solution and its unique features, enabling more compact X-ray sources with sub-fs pulse duration and ultra-fast electron diffraction},

	abstract = {Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) has gained much attention recently because of its promise for the development of compact X-ray light sources. Precise and fast simulation is an essential tool for predicting the radiation property of a given machine design and to optimize its parameters. This thesis focuses on the development of the ICS simulation model. In particular, two computational techniques used in the simulation model are considered: the calculation of the radiation spectra and the computation of the space-charge field.The calculation of radiation spectra is based on the Liénard-Wiechert potential. Instead of the conventional method which directly evaluates the discretized Fourier integral of the Liénard-Wiechert field (called frequency-domain method), we focus on an approach referred to as the time-domain method, where the field is recorded along the observer's time on a uniform time grid which is then used to compute the radiation spectra after completion of the simulation. Besides the derivation and implementation details of the proposed method, we analyze possible parallelization schemes and compare the parallel performance of the proposed time-domain method with the frequency-domain method. We will characterize scenarios/conditions under which one method is expected to outperform the other.The computation of the space-charge field is based on fast summation methods. Based on Lagrange Interpolation, we formulate a treecode and a fast-multipole method (FMM) for the efficient computation of the relativistic space-charge field. In particular, we propose two approaches to control the interpolation error. In the first approach, we derive a modified admissibility condition (ADMC) from the analysis of the interpolation error; with the modified ADMC, the treecode/FMM can be used directly in the lab-frame. The second approach relies on the transformation of the particle beam to the rest-frame where the conventional admissibility condition can be applied. Our numerical results show that two approaches can effectively control the interpolation error and the approach based on the modified ADMC is more accurate for a particle beam with larger momentum spread. The implementation and the GPU parallelization of the solver are also discussed. Our GPU solver can achieve a speedup of roughly 200 compared to the CPU solver},

	abstract = {The key feature of X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) is their capability to generate ultrashort and at least partially coherent X-ray pulses with extreme intensity. This capability holds the promise to revolutionize X-ray physics in a way similar to how lasers have revolutionized optics, as the non-linear and coherent interactions known from theoptical regime combined with the properties of X-ray radiation could enable techniques with unprecedented analyzing power. This thesis summarizes several contributions tothe development from linear to non-linear X-ray spectroscopies at XFELs. To begin with, I address the technical challenge of normalizing the spectral intensity fluctuationsof XFEL-radiation by presenting several versions of the split-beam normalization scheme. Versions suitable for both monochromatic and broadband measurements, either in transmission through liquids or metal films or in reflection from bulk-supported samples are demonstrated and their capabilities and performance are compared. Moving to non-parametric high-fluence studies, we present a non-linear absorption study at the nickel L3-edge using a monochromatic split-beam normalization scheme. We interpret the fluence-dependent spectral changes by characterizing the evolution of the electronic system during interaction with the X-ray pulse using a rate model that quantifiesthe photon absorption and electronic scattering processes. Further, we show a similar non-linear absorption experiment that utilizes a broadband split-beam normalization scheme. While we observe a comparable evolution ofthe electronic system, the broadband incident radiation leads to a strong contribution of stimulated inelastic scattering that is up to six orders of magnitude stronger than the spontaneous contribution that is exploited in conventional Resonant Inelastic X-rayScattering (RIXS). Finally, we demonstrate sum and difference frequency generation between core-resonant XFEL-photons with two infrared photons for the first time. The observed photon-energy dependence of the third-order non-linear susceptibility suggests an enhancement through coupling between the 1s2p and 1s2s excited states, thus demonstratinga key capability of wave-mixing spectroscopy methods. In summary, the presented work contributes to the development of non-linear X-rayspectroscopy on various fronts, but further developments will be needed to bring X-ray wave-mixing techniques into their preconceived position to deliver unprecedented insights into molecular and solid-state dynamics},

	title = {Positron acceleration in a plasma column},
	abstract = {The particle physics community has expressed significant interest in a 10 TeV-class electron-positron collider to advance our understanding of matter. However, the costs associated with such a collider usingconventional radio-frequency technology seem to be prohibitive. Thus,significant research and development is needed on the accelerator sideto reduce both construction and power consumption costs.Plasma-based accelerators, due to their extremely high acceleratinggradients, are a potential solution to reduce construction costs.Although significant progress has been made in plasma-based electronacceleration in recent years, positron acceleration still poses anotorious challenge and has been identified as a critical point in therealization of a plasma-based electron-positron collider. Additionally,plasma-based positron acceleration, while preserving the requiredhigh beam quality for a collider, is challenging even conceptually anddifficult to model with currently available simulation tools.Positron acceleration in a plasma column is a promising new conceptowing to its high accelerating gradient and the ability to preservepositron beam emittance, a fundamental requirement for a collider.In this scheme, a relativistic electron beam travels along the axis of aplasma column, driving a plasma wake in the blowout regime. Dueto the finite radius of the plasma, the restoring force acting on theplasma electrons is reduced and the plasma electrons return in a long,high-density electron filament to the axis some distance behind thedriver. This electron filament generates high-gradient accelerating andfocusing fields for positrons. However, questions regarding stabilityand beam quality remain.In this thesis, positron acceleration in a plasma column is put tothe test. Beyond proof of concept, the acceleration of high-qualitypositron beams and its resilience to realistic conditions, such as misalignmentis demonstrated. Realistic plasma profiles and temperatureeffects are also considered and found to be beneficial to the scheme.The results show that positron acceleration in a plasma column isindeed a viable concept for a possible collider application, althoughadditional research is needed to optimize efficiency. Furthermore, theGPU-accelerated, quasi-static Particle-in-Cell code HiPACE++ has beendeveloped. The new code allows for modeling plasma-based positronacceleration scenarios in full 3D with previously unattainable precisionwhile drastically reducing computational costs, enabling thestudies presented. An outlook for the next possible steps towards aplasma-based collider is given},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0506231},
	abstract = {This paper describes a theory of transverse coherence properties of Undulator Radiation. Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific predictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of the beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume that the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or generalized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field approximation. The VCZ theorem is derived in the frame of Statistical Optics using a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneous assumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situations regarding undulator sources. We propose a technique to calculate the cross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. Also, we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and we present an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is valid up to the exit of the undulator. For the case of more general undulator sources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated from numerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found. Finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherence properties of an X-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherent spot-size on a sample. This invention was devised almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the state-of-the-art in polymer-based 3-D printing of metal-pipe rectangular waveguides (MPRWGs) with the first reported terahertz filters, all operating within the WR-2.2 band (325 to 500 GHz): a 5 mm-long thru line, two 399 GHz single-cavity resonators and two 403 GHz bandpass filters (BPFs). Our thru line exhibits a measured average insertion loss of only 0.9 dB, with a worst-case return loss of 13.3 dB, across the band. The single-cavity resonators, without and with corner rounding compensation (CRC) are investigated with the use of an 
RLC
equivalent circuit model. The uncompensated resonator exhibits a 2.3\% frequency downshift and an increase of 10.8 GHz in its 3 dB bandwidth. The compensated resonator exhibits a 2.2\% frequency upshift and an increase of only 2.2 GHz in its 3 dB bandwidth; clearly demonstrating that CRC helps to mitigate against increased coupling into the resonators, as a result of manufacturing limitations with low-cost 3-D printing. Finally, the 3
rd
order Butterworth and Chebyshev MPRWG BPFs both have a measured passband insertion loss of only 1.0 dB. The Butterworth filter exhibits a 0.8\% passband frequency upshift and worst-case return loss of 16.6 dB; while the Chebyshev filter exhibits a 1.2\% passband frequency downshift and worst-case return loss of 10.4 dB. With our low-cost polymer-based 3-D printing technology, we have demonstrated measured performances that are better than those using metal-based 3-D printing in the WR-2.2 band and this may, in the not too distant future, challenge components manufactured using traditional machining technologies.},

This contribution describes the new FEL code GENESIS 1.3 which uses a fully three-dimensional representation of the FEL equations in the paraxial approximation for time-dependent and steady-state simulations of single-pass FEL. In particular this approach is suitable for cases where the radial symmetry is broken by the electron beam distribution as well as by wiggler errors, betatron motion and off axis injection of the electron beam. The results, presented here, are based on the parameters of the TESLA Test Facility FEL at DESY.},

	abstract = {A new version of the popular X-ray tracing code SHADOW is presented. An important step has been made in restructuring the code following new computer engineering standards, ending with a modular Fortran 2003 structure and an application programming interface (API). The new code has been designed to be compatible with the original file-oriented SHADOW philosophy, but simplifying the compilation, installation and use. In addition, users can now become programmers using the newly designed SHADOW3 API for creating scripts, macros and programs; being able to deal with optical system optimization, image simulation, and also low transmission calculations requiring a large number of rays ({\textgreater}106). Plans for future development and questions on how to accomplish them are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The demand for wireless connectivity has grown exponentially over the last few decades. Fifth-generation (5G) communications, with far more features than fourth-generation communications, will soon be deployed worldwide. A new paradigm of wireless communication, the sixth-generation (6G) system, with the full support of artificial intelligence, is expected to be implemented between 2027 and 2030. Beyond 5G, some fundamental issues that need to be addressed are higher system capacity, higher data rate, lower latency, higher security, and improved quality of service (QoS) compared to the 5G system. This paper presents the vision of future 6G wireless communication and its network architecture. This article describes emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, terahertz communications, wireless optical technology, free-space optical network, blockchain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communications, unmanned aerial vehicles, cell-free communications, integration of wireless information and energy transfer, integrated sensing and communication, integrated access-backhaul networks, dynamic network slicing, holographic beamforming, backscatter communication, intelligent reflecting surface, proactive caching, and big data analytics that can assist the 6G architecture development in guaranteeing the QoS. Besides, expected applications with 6G communication requirements and possible technologies are presented. We also describe potential challenges and research directions for achieving this goal.},

	abstract = {Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because of the wide swaths of unused and unexplored spectrum. These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed. This paper offers the first in-depth look at the vast applications of THz wireless products and applications and provides approaches for how to reduce power and increase performance across several problem domains, giving early evidence that THz techniques are compelling and available for future wireless communications.},

	abstract = {One of the most common and important tasks in wave optics simulation is choosing what mesh spacings and mesh dimensions1 to use for a given problem. To obtain correct results, it is crucial that the mesh spacings are sufficiently small and the mesh dimensions sufficiently large, but if one makes the spacings too small, or the dimensions too large, that can greatly increase the simulation run time, and that may be unaffordable. It is therefore important to understand exactly what the applicable constraints are, so that one may choose mesh spacings and dimensions that will yield correct results without being over-conservative. However this problem can be nontrivial, especially when modeling propagation through aberrating media, or when there is potentially useful a priori information available which might allow us to relax the modeling constraints. For example, if the light source is known to be well-collimated, we know that all of the light to be modeled will be concentrated along one axis, allowing us to use smaller meshes than we would if the light were uncollimated. Similarly, if the receiver has a limited field of view, we need not model any light incident upon it from angles outside its field of view. In this paper we present a simple general method to determine what mesh spacings and dimensions will work for any given wave optics propagation problem, including problems involving propagation through aberrating media and/or a priori information about the source and/or receiver.},

The model is also capable of predicting the transforming effects of small scale surface structures on focusing mirrors in a simplified manner. A method for modelling such features has been suggested, and implemented in this simulation. A complimentary study of small scale surface irregularities was also conducted, details of which can be found in ref [15].},

	abstract = {The terahertz frequency band (0.1–10 THz) is a promising candidate to meet the high bandwidth demand set by the next generation of wireless communications systems. So far, most of the THz communication prototypes have been demonstrated for free-space wireless environments. Although wireless systems present many advantages such as convenience for mobile end-users and easier upgrades, many challenges remain. Notably, wireless links are prone to high alignment errors due to the highly directional nature of the THz beam. In turn, this requires complex beamsteering algorithms for reliable communication. This situation is even worse for non-line-of-sight links in indoor communications, for example. In this context, THz waveguides can be an additional tool in the design of future THz networks. They can offer reliable coupling to the receiver and transmitter by enclosing the THz radiation in a highly controlled propagation medium. They can span complex geometrical paths in both static and dynamic operations. Advanced THz waveguides can be used for real-time signal processing as an alternative to all-electronic solutions. In this chapter, we cover the most recent advances of THz waveguides applied to THz communications. We start by proposing several applications where THz waveguides/devices can be beneficial. Then, we present the inherent challenges related to the design of THz waveguides for communications. We then cover various types of THz waveguides developed in recent years. Finally, we show all-waveguide designs of passive/active components such as dispersion compensators, couplers, splitters, and add-drop multiplexers for signal processing.},

	abstract = {Following the current development of the wireless technology landscape, and with respect to the constant growth in user demands, it is inevitable that next-generation mobile wireless networks will use new frequency bands located in the sub-terahertz and terahertz (THz) spectrum to complement the existing microwave and millimeter wave (mmWave) channels. The feasibility of point-to-point stationary THz communication links has already been experimentally demonstrated. To build upon this breakthrough, one of the pressing research targets is making THz communication systems truly mobile. Achieving this target is especially complicated because mobile THz wireless systems (including WLANs and even cellular access) will often operate in the near-field due to the very large (even though physically small) electrical size of the high-gain antenna systems required for making high-rate communication links feasible at such frequencies. This perspective article presents several key prospective research challenges envisioned on the way to designing efficient mobile near-field THz wireless access as a part of 6G and 7G wireless landscapes.},

Since the number of antennas is very large for ELAA, the electromagnetic radiation field needs to be modeled by near-field spherical waves, which is opposed to the conventional planar-wave-based radiation model of 5G massive MIMO. As a result, near-field communications will become essential in 6G wireless networks. In this article, we systematically investigate the emerging near-field communication techniques. Firstly, we present the fundamentals of near-field communications and the metric to determine the near-field ranges in typical communication scenarios. Then, we investigate recent studies specific to near-field communications by classifying them into two categories, i.e., techniques addressing the challenges and those exploiting the potentials in near-field regions. Their principles, recent progress, pros and cons are discussed. More importantly, several open problems and future research directions for near-field communications are pointed out. We believe that this article would inspire more innovations for this important research topic of near-field communications for 6G.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603269},
	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the image formation problem for undulator radiation through an optical system, accounting for the inﬂuence of the electron beam emittance. On the one hand, image formation with Synchrotron Radiation is governed by the laws of Statistical Optics. On the other hand, the widely used GaussianShell model cannot be applied to describe the coherence properties of X-ray beams from third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required. We propose a technique to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source, that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system. At ﬁrst we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non-limiting pupil aperture. Our theory, which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, also allows treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their applicability region. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, which is relevant for third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. First principle calculations of undulator radiation characteristics (i.e. ten-dimensional integrals) are then reduced to one-dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions speciﬁc for undulator radiation sources. We also consider the imaging problem for a non-ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture, which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three. In particular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observation plane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and the intensity from an ideal lens. Our results may be used in practical cases as well as in benchmarks for numerical methods.},

Tunable gap undulators provide the possibility to change the radiation wavelength in a wide range. Operation with diﬀerent bunch charges (0.02, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 nC) provides the possibility to operate XFEL with diﬀerent radiation pulse duration.

The imagers will usually absorb the beam (invasive devices), however, for some applications they will be partially transmissive to allow for beam pointing monitoring together with a second imaging unit further downstream.

	abstract = {Hard X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate intense coherent X-ray beams by passing electrons through undulators, i.e. very long periodic magnet structures, which extend over hundreds of meters. The SASE1 and SASE2 undulator systems of the European XFEL consist of 35 segments with variable-gap planar undulators which are initially tuned to precise on-axis magnetic field strengths in a magnetic measurement laboratory to keep an important quality parameter – the K-value variation from segment to segment – below a certain limit (3 × 10−4 for 12 keV photon energy). After tunnel installation only photon-based methods can determine the K-values of undulator segments with a similar accuracy. The synchrotron radiation from a single or a few segments can be spectrally filtered by a dedicated crystal monochromator (K-monochromator) and recorded with a photodiode or with an imager that provides 2D information, tuned for high sensitivity to detect low photon densities from distant single undulator segments. This instrumentation is applied for electron orbit analysis and optimization, and adjustment of individual undulators in terms of their central magnetic axis with respect to the electron beam. Single undulator segments were analysed by scanning the monochromator crystal angle and detecting the steepest slope of a photodiode signal. Alternatively, in the imaging method, an imager recorded the radiation cone of electrons passing through the undulator segment. From the spatial distribution of the radiation, the K-parameter was determined with a sufficiently high relative accuracy.},

              e.g.
              extreme pulse energies in the soft X-ray range). To solve this issue, lasing of double electron bunches, separated by 28 periods of the driving radiofrequency (at 1.3 GHz), timed for the temporal overlap of THz and X-ray pulses at the experimental station has been employed. In order to optimize conditions for a typical THz pump X-ray probe experiment, X-ray lasing of the first bunch to one-sixth of that of the second has been suppressed. Finally, synchronization of THz radiation pulses was measured to be ∼20 fs (r.m.s.), and a solution for monitoring the arrival time for achieving higher temporal resolution is presented.},

Combination of these pulses, along with the auxiliary NIR and VIS ultrashort lasers, supports a plethora of dynamic investigations in physics, material science and biology. The unique features of the FLASH THz pulses and the accelerator source, however, bring along a set of challenges in the diagnostics of their key parameters: pulse energy, spectral, temporal and spatial profiles. Here, these challenges are discussed and the pulse diagnostic tools developed at FLASH are presented. In particular, a radiometric power measurement is presented that enables the derivation of the average pulse energy within a pulse burst across the spectral range, jitter-corrected electro-optical sampling for the full spectro-temporal pulse characterization, spatial beam profiling along the beam transport line and at the sample, and a lamellar grating based Fourier transform infrared spectrometer for the on-line assessment of the average THz pulse spectra. Corresponding measurement results provide a comprehensive insight into the THz beamline capabilities.},

	abstract = {The generation of attosecond, highbrightness x-ray pulses is a matter of great interest given their applications in the study of ultra-fast processes. In recent years, the production of x-ray pulses of high brightness, both in the soft and in the hard x-ray range, has been enabled by x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). In contrast to conventional quantum lasers, XFELs are based on the use of an ultra-relativistic electron beam as gain medium. They often work in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime, which provides pulses of duration down to a few femtoseconds, composed of several longitudinal modes. In order to further decrease the duration of these pulses, special methods need to be implemented. In this paper we review available methods, with particular focus on the x-ray laser-enhanced attosecond pulse generation, which is one of the most promising techniques. We illustrate the method using the SASE3 soft x-ray undulator of the European XFEL facility as a case study, emphasizing the importance of high-repetition rate attosecond x-ray pulses. The expected attosecond-level radiation output is used for simulations of sequential ionization processes in atoms in the case of ionization in the soft x-ray regime, demonstrating the importance of this opportunity for the user community.},

We leverage the power of artificial intelligence to build a neural network model using experimental data, in order to bring the destructive longitudinal phase space (LPS) diagnostics online virtually and improve the existing current profile online diagnostics which uses a coherent transition radiation (CTR) spectrometer. The model can also serve as a digital twin of the real machine on which algorithms can be tested efficiently and effectively. We demonstrate at the FLASH facility that the encoder-decoder model with more than one decoder can make highly accurate predictions of megapixel LPS images and coherent transition radiation spectra concurrently for electron bunches in a bunch train with broad ranges of LPS shapes and peak currents, which are obtained by scanning all the major control knobs for LPS manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a way to significantly improve the CTR spectrometer online measurement by combining the predicted and measured spectra.

New results are presented on the impact of energy spread on the brightness and coherence as a function of the emittance. In contrast to other work on this topic, it is found that as emittance decreases, the effect of energy spread increases, but as the diffraction limit is approached, the behavior of brightness and coherence diverge. The accuracy of the commonly used Gaussian approximation for brightness and coherence is also explored in detail, resulting in a new conclusion that the commonly used projected source sizes and divergences are not the appropriate quantities to use in the Gaussian approximation to obtain the most accurate results. New expressions are derived for the rms source size and divergence as a function of the energy spread for use in the Gaussian approximation.},

	abstract = {It :is often convenient to use synthetically generated random fields to study the hydrologic effects of spatial heterogeneity. Although there are many ways to produce such fields, spectral techniques are particularly attractive because they are: fast and conceptually straightforward. This paper describes a spectral algorithm for generating sets of random fields which are correlated with one another. The algorithm is based on a discrete version of the Fourier-Stieltjes representation for multidimensional random fields. The Fourier increment used in this representation depends on a random phase angle process and a complex-valued spectral factor matrix which can be readily derived from a specified set of crossspectral densities (or cross-covariances). The inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier increment is a complex random field with real and imaginary parts which each have the desired coveriance structure. Our complex-valued spectral formulation provides an especially convenient way to generate a set of random fields which all depend on a single underlying (independent) field, provided that the fields in qu’estion can be related by space-invariant linear transformations. We illustrate this by generating multi-dimensional mass conservative groundwater velocity fields which can be used to simulate solute transport through heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0},
	abstract = {ight is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?

The experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.

The way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.},

Temporal coherence is related to the intrinsic spectrum bandwidth of the light source, while spatial coherence can be affected by the size of the light source and propagation distance in use. These two coherence properties are measured for various light sources of diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser, laser diode (LD), light emitting diode (LED), super luminescent light emitting diode (sLED) and micro light emitting diode (mLED) in different settings, together with the quality of the holographic reconstructed images. Although the image sharpness and speckle are related to both coherence parameters, our results and subsequent analysis show that the spatial coherence can be linked directly to the image sharpness and the temporal coherence to the speckle. This will provide a quantitative way not only to optimize the image quality between uniformity and sharpness but also to determine the safety power level for different light sources when viewing the produced images by human eyes directly.},

The method was tested at the soft X-ray SASE3 undulator of the European XFEL. The first part of the undulator allows one to amplify bunching at the fundamental as well as the higher harmonics. The downstream undulator is tuned to a harmonic, the fourth in our case, to amplify pulses with a shorter duration. We estimate the generated pulse duration within such a subset of short pulses at a level of 650 as. Considering the demonstrated probability of single spike events, this method is attractive for high repetition-rate free electron lasers.},

The superconducting technology allows for the acceleration of many electron bunches within one radio-frequency pulse of the accelerating voltage and, in turn, for the generation of a large number of hard X-ray pulses. We report on the performance of the European XFEL accelerator with up to 5,000 electron bunches per second and demonstrating a full energy of 17.5 GeV. Feedback mechanisms enable stabilization of the electron beam delivery at the FEL undulator in space and time. The measured FEL gain curve at 9.3 keV is in good agreement with predictions for saturated FEL radiation. Hard X-ray lasing was achieved between 7 keV and 14 keV with pulse energies of up to 2.0 mJ. Using the high repetition rate, an FEL beam with 6 W average power was created.},

              ) is a new GPU-based simulation code to compute the transverse coherence of undulator radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons. The core structure of the code, which is written in the language C++ accelerated with CUDA, combines an analytical description of the emitted electric fields and massively parallel computations on GPUs. The combination is rigorously justified by a statistical description of synchrotron radiation based on a Fourier optics approach.

					This field can be consequently propagated from the source position
					downstream through an optical beamline to the sample position. The
					proposed algorithm relies on a method for simulating Gaussian random
					fields. We initially generate the radiation field as Gaussian white
					noise and then restrict it in both real and inverse space domains for
					a given radiation size and divergence. We exploit the assumption of
					quasi-homogeneity of the source. However, we show that the method is
					applicable with reasonable accuracy outside of this assumption. The
					proposed algorithm is consistent with other well-established
					approaches, and, in addition, it possesses an advantage in terms of
					computational efficiency. It can be extended to other types of sources
					that follow Gaussian statistics. Finally, the demonstration of the

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0691},
	abstract = {Robb and Bonifacio (2011) claimed that a previously neglected quantum effect results in noticeable changes in the evolution of the energy distribution associated with spontaneous emission in long undulators. They revisited theoretical models used to describe the emission of radiation by relativistic electrons as a continuous diffusive process, and claimed that in the asymptotic limit for a large number of undulator periods the evolution of the electron energy distribution occurs as discrete energy groups according to Poisson distribution. We show that these novel results have no physical sense, because they are based on a one-dimensional model of spontaneous emission and assume that electrons are sheets of charge. However, electrons are point-like particles and, as is well-known, the bandwidth of the angular-integrated spectrum of undulator radiation is independent of the number of undulator periods. If we determine the evolution of the energy distribution using a three-dimensional theory we find the well-known results consistent with a continuous diffusive process. The additional pedagogical purpose of this paper is to review how quantum diffusion of electron energy in an undulator with small undulator parameter can be simply analyzed using the Thomson cross-section expression, unlike the conventional treatment based on the expression for the Lienard-Wiechert fields.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss a method for nondestructive measurements of the longitudinal profile of sub-picosecond electron bunches for X-Ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs). The method is based on the detection of the Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) spectrum produced by a bunch passing a dipole magnet system. This work also contains a systematic treatment of synchrotron radiation theory which lies at the basis of CSR. Standard theory of synchrotron radiation uses several approximations whose applicability limits are often forgotten: here we present a systematic discussion about these assumptions. Properties of coherent synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along an arc of a circle are then derived and discussed. We describe also an effective and practical diagnostic technique based on the utilization of an electromagnetic undulator to record the energy of the coherent radiation pulse into the central cone. This measurement must be repeated many times with different undulator resonant frequencies in order to reconstruct the modulus of the bunch form-factor. The retrieval of the bunch profile function from these data is performed by means of deconvolution techniques: for the present work we take advantage of a constrained deconvolution method. We illustrate with numerical examples the potential of the proposed method for electron beam diagnostics at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) accelerator. Here we choose, for emphasis, experiments aimed at the measure of the strongly non-Gaussian electron bunch profile in the TTF femtosecond-mode operation. We demonstrate that a tandem combination of a picosecond streak camera and a CSR spectrometer can be used to extract shape information from electron bunches with a narrow leading peak and a long tail.},

The focusing with lenses of the radiation emitted by an undulator in a fourth-generation storage ring (EBS-ESRF) is studied.

Similar devices have been tested in several places at relatively low energies (∼100 MeV) and with relatively long bunches ({\textgreater}1 ps). In the parameter regime of the LCLS dechirper, with the corrugation size similar to the gap between the plates, the analytical solutions of the wakefields are no longer applicable, and we resort to a field matching program to obtain the wakes. Based on the numerical calculations, we fit the short-range, longitudinal wakes to simple formulas, valid over a large, useful parameter range. Finally, since the transverse wakefields—both dipole and quadrupole—are strong, we compute and include them in beam dynamics simulations to investigate the error tolerances when this device is introduced in the LCLS.},

Ultrafast physical and chemical dynamics, initiated with a site-specific X-ray pulse, can be explored using XFELs with a second ultrashort X-ray probe pulse. However, existing double-pulse schemes are complicated, difficult to customize or provide only low-intensity pulses. Here we present the novel fresh-slice technique for multicolour pulse production, wherein different temporal slices of an electron bunch lase to saturation in separate undulator sections. This method combines electron bunch tailoring from a passive wakefield device with trajectory control to provide multicolour pulses. The fresh-slice scheme outperforms existing techniques at soft X-ray wavelengths. It produces femtosecond pulses with a power of tens of gigawatts and flexible colour separation. The pulse delay can be varied from temporal overlap to almost one picosecond. We also demonstrate the first three-colour XFEL and variably polarized two-colour pulses.},

The spatial chirp is generated using an RF deflector which produces a transverse offset (in y and/or y′) correlated with the longitudinal bunch position. Since the FEL gain is very sensitive to an initial offset in the transverse phase space at the entrance of the undulator, only a small portion of the electron bunch with relatively small transverse offset will interact significantly with the radiation, resulting in an X-ray pulse length much shorter than the electron bunch length. The X-ray pulse is also naturally phase locked to the RF deflector and so allows high precision timing synchronization. We discuss the generation and transport of such a spatially chirped electron beam and show that tens of femotsecond long pulse can be generated for the linac coherent light source.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in free-electron laser (FEL) physics and accelerator techniques led to the possibility of generating coherent X-ray radiation with self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL. Despite the fact that the SASE FEL is capable of providing much higher peak brilliance than spontaneous synchrotron radiation sources, there is a great potential for improvements. The brilliance of the output radiation from the SASE FEL is mainly limited by the poor longitudinal coherence of the radiation. One of the approaches to obtain fully coherent X-ray radiation uses frequency multiplication, a scheme known as the high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) FEL. In the HGHG FEL the radiation output is derived from a coherent subharmonic laser seed pulse. Consequently, the optical properties of the HGHG FEL are expected to reflect the characteristics of the high-quality seed laser. This paper is devoted to the investigation of the physical processes in the HGHG FEL. Our studies have shown that the frequency multiplication process produces noise degradation proportional at least to the square of the frequency multiplication factor. This prevents operation of HGHG FEL at a very short wavelength range.},

	abstract = {The spectroscopic techniques for time-resolved fine analysis of matter require coherent x-ray radiation with femtosecond duration and high average brightness. Seeded free-electron lasers (FELs), which use the frequency up-conversion of an external seed laser to improve temporal coherence, are ideal for providing fully coherent soft x-ray pulses. However, it is difficult to operate seeded FELs at a high repetition rate due to the limitations of present state-of-the-art laser systems. Here, we report a novel self-modulation method for enhancing laser-induced energy modulation, thereby significantly reducing the requirement of an external laser system. Driven by this scheme, we experimentally realize high harmonic generation in a seeded FEL using an unprecedentedly small external laser-induced energy modulation. An electron beam with a laser-induced energy modulation as small as 1.8 times the slice energy spread is used for lasing at the seventh harmonic of a 266-nm seed laser in a single-stage high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) setup and the 30th harmonic of the seed laser in a two-stage HGHG setup. The results mark a major step toward a high-repetition-rate, fully coherent x-ray FEL.},

Leveraging on non-linearities generated through longitudinal dispersion in the system, we obtain electron bunching at a frequency difference ωFM = ω2 − ω1. FEL ampliﬁcation at ωFM follows in a few last radiator segments. We report on the generation of frequency mixing at photon energies between 500 eV and 1100 eV with pulse energies, depending on the length of the radiator, in the mJ level. This method allows generating low photon energies in cases where the FEL runs at high electron energy and the target photon energy cannot be reached in the main undulator, with the simple addition of a short, custom-made afterburner.},

Here, the focus is monochromatic operation of the SASE3 beamline, and the design and performance of the SASE3 grating monochromator are reported. The unique capability of a free-electron laser source to produce short femtosecond pulses of a high degree of coherence challenges the monochromator design by demanding control of both photon energy and temporal resolution. The aim to transport close to transform-limited pulses poses very high demands on the optics quality, in particular on the grating. The current realization of the SASE3 monochromator is discussed in comparison with optimal design performance. At present, the monochromator operates with two gratings: the low-resolution grating is optimized for time-resolved experiments and allows for moderate resolving power of about 2000–5000 along with pulse stretching of a few to a few tens of femtoseconds RMS, and the high-resolution grating reaches a resolving power of 10 000 at the cost of larger pulse stretching.},

In this paper, we present a generalized formula for the fluctuations with a non-negligible beam divergence. Further, we corroborate this formula in a dedicated experiment with undulator radiation in the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab. Lastly, possible applications in beam instrumentation are discussed.},

	abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers provide short, polarized, high-power pulses of x-ray radiation, where polarization properties are determined by the undulator magnetic field. We propose a cost-effective method to shape the polarization of FEL radiation on the sample both spatially, on a few-μm scale, and/or temporally on the 100-femtosecond scale. The method is based on coaxial superposition of two coherent radiation pulses with different frequencies emitted in two consequent undulators set to emit radiation with orthogonal polarization states. Its capabilities are demonstrated via numerical simulations for the SASE3 undulator line of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser. Generation of x-ray free-electron laser pulses with shaped polarization may be interesting for studies of magnetism or ultrafast phenomena and will facilitate further developments of complex light engineering in the soft X-ray range.},

(SASE1, SASE2 and SASE3) covering the energy range from 250 eV to 24 keV. It will provide up to 2700 pulses in
trains of 600 microsecond duration at a repetition rate of 10 Hz.
SASE3 beamline is the soft X-ray beamline (0.25 - 3 keV) and delivers photon pulses to SQS (Small Quantum System)

non-monochromatic mode. The latter provides the inherent FEL bandwidth at higher intensities. The beamline from
photon source to experimental station is about 450 m long. The length of the beamline is related to the optics single-shotdamage
issue. The almost diffraction-limited beam is propagated along the beamline with very long (up to 800 mm clear
aperture), cooled (with eutectic bath) and super-polished (50 nrad RMS slope error and less than 3 nm PV residual height
error) mirrors. The VLS-PG (variable line spacing - plane grating) monochromator covers the entire beamline energy
range and its optical design is guided by the optimization of the energy resolving power, the minimization of the pulse
broadening and the maximization of optics damage tolerance. Grating substrates are 530 mm long, eutectic cooled and
present outstanding surface quality. The VLS parameters of the blazed profile are also a real challenge under
manufacturing and measuring point of view. Adaptive optics in the horizontal (the second offset mirror) and vertical

the highly coherent beam properties.

The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.},

Later Hilbert space-valued Wiener processes are constructed out of these random fields. A short introduction to infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis and stochastic differential equations is given. Furthermore different definitions of numerical stability for the discretization of stochastic partial differential equations are presented and the numerical stability of the heat equation with additive and multiplicative noise is explicitely computed using semigroup theory. Finally stochastic active contours are used for segmentation. This thesis generalizes work done by Juan et al. and does the simulation of different stochastic partial differential equations.

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15014373},
	abstract = {Synchrotron Radiation (SR) has been widely used since the 80's as a tool for many applications of UV, soft X rays and hard X rays in condensed matter physics, chemistry and biology. The evolution of SR sources towards higher brightness has led to the design of low-emittance electron storage rings (emittance is the product of beam size and divergence), and the development of special source magnetic structures, as undulators. This means that more and more photons are available on a narrow bandwidth and on a small collimated beam; in other words there is the possibility of getting a high power in a coherent beam. In most applications, a monochromator is used, and the temporal coherence of the light is given by the monochromator bandwidth. With smaller and smaller sources, even without the use of collimators, the spatial coherence of the light has become appreciable, first in the UV and soft X ray range, and then also with hard X rays. This has made possible new or improved experiments in interferometry, microscopy, holography, correlation spectroscopy, etc. In view of these recent possibilities and applications, it is useful to review some basic concepts about spatial coherence of SR, and its measurement and applications. In particular we show how the spatial coherence properties of the radiation in the far field can be calculated with simple operations from the single-electron amplitude and the electron beam angular and position spreads. The gaussian approximation will be studied in detail for a discussion of the properties of the far field mutual coherence and the estimate of the coherence widths, and the comparison with the VanCittert-Zernike limit.},

	abstract = {The emerging concept of `beam by design' in free-electron laser (FEL) accelerator physics aims for accurate manipulation of the electron beam to tailor spectral and temporal properties of the radiation for specific experimental purposes, such as X-ray pump/X-ray probe and multiple wavelength experiments. `Beam by design' requires fast, efficient, and detailed feedback on the spectral and temporal properties of the generated X-ray radiation. Here a simple and cost-efficient method to extract information on the longitudinal Wigner distribution function of emitted FEL pulses is proposed. The method requires only an ensemble of measured FEL spectra and is rather robust with respect to accelerator fluctuations. The method is applied to both the simulated SASE spectra with known radiation properties as well as to the SASE spectra measured at the European XFEL revealing underlying non-linear chirp of the generated radiation. In the Appendices an intuitive understanding of time–frequency representations of chirped SASE radiation is provided.},

	abstract = {This book contains a systematic treatment of the basic principles of free elec tron laser (FEL) physics. It is primarily intended for physicists specializing in FEL physics and related fields: laser physics, microwave electronics, particle accelerator physics, etc. At the same time it might be useful for those who use the FEL as a research or industrial tool. The treatment requires that the reader has a knowledge of classical me chanics and electrodynamics. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the kinetic theory of charged particle beams, in particular the Vlasov equa tion. All the results presented here are derived from "first principles", and all steps involving physical principles are given. To preserve a self-consistent style, we place the derivation of auxiliary results in appendices. Theoretical study is performed with an extensive use of similarity tech niques, so the results obtained are simultaneously highly general and com pletely specified. The use of similarity techniques involves a particular way of thinking and leads to a deeper insight into FEL physics. We use a synthetic approach to present the material: some simple models are studied first, and more complicated ones are introduced gradually. We start with the one-dimensional theory of the FEL amplifier and FEL oscilla tor. Then we move on the analysis of diffraction effects and waveguide effects. Finally, we introduce the reader to the part of FEL theory dealing with the start-up from shot noise in the electron beam.},

	abstract = {IntroductionWe will now study the properties of fluctuating electromagnetic fields, paying attention mainly to the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It seems hardly necessary to stress that every electromagnetic field found in nature has some fluctuations associated with it. Even though these fluctuations are, as a rule, much too rapid to be observed directly, one can deduce their existence from suitable experiments that provide information about correlations between the fluctuations at two or more space-time points.The simplest manifestations of correlations in optical fields are the well-known interference effects that arise when two light beams that originate from the same source are superposed. With the availability of modern light detectors and electronic circuitry of very short resolving time, other types of correlations in optical fields began to be studied in more recent times. These investigations, as well as the development of lasers and other novel types of light sources, led to a systematic classification of optical correlation phenomena and the complete statistical description of optical fields. The area of optics concerned with such questions is now generally known as optical coherence theory.The first investigations of coherence phenomena are due to Verdet (1865, 1869) and von Laue (1907a, b). Some early investigations of Stokes (1852) and Michelson (1890, 1891a, b, c, 1892, 1920) although not explicitly mentioning coherence – because this concept is of a much later origin – have also contributed to the clarification and development of this subject.},

	abstract = {This work contains a systematic treatment of single particle Synchrotron Radiation and some application to realistic beams with given cross section area, divergence and energy spread. Standard theory relies on several approximations whose applicability limits and accuracy are often forgotten. We begin remarking that on the one hand, a paraxial approximation can always be applied without loss of generality and with ultra relativistic accuracy. On the other hand, dominance of the acceleration field over the velocity part in the Lienard-Wiechert expressions is not always granted and constitutes a separate assumption, whose applicability is discussed. Treating Synchrotron Radiation in paraxial approximation we derive the equation for the slow varying envelope function of the Fourier components of the electric field vector. Calculations of Synchrotron Radiation properties performed by others showed that the phase of the Fourier components of the electric field vector differs from the phase of a virtual point source. In this paper we present a systematic, analytical description of this phase shift, calculating amplitude and phase of electric field from bending magnets, short magnets, two bending magnet system separated by a straight section (edge radiation) and undulator devices. We pay particular attention to region of applicability and accuracy of approximations used. Finally, taking advantage of results of analytical calculation presented in reduced form we analyze various features of radiation from a complex insertion device (set of two undulators with a focusing triplet in between) accounting for the influence of energy spread and electron beam emittance.},

Special attention is payed in discussing the validity of approximations upon which the theory is built. Our study makes consistent use of both similarity techniques and comparisons with numerical results from simulation. We discuss both near and far zone. Physical understanding of many asymptotes is discussed. Based on the solution of the field equation with a tensor Green's function technique, we also discuss an analytical model to describe the presence of a vacuum chamber. In particular, explicit calculations for a circular vacuum chamber are reported. Finally, we consider the use of Edge Radiation as a tool for electron beam diagnostics. We discuss Coherent Edge Radiation, Extraction of Edge Radiation by a mirror, and other issues becoming important at high electron energy and long radiation wavelength. Based on this work we also study the impact of Edge Radiation on XFEL setups and we discuss recent results.},

	abstract = {Harmonic lasing provides an opportunity to extend the photon energy range of existing and planned x-ray free electron laser (FEL) user facilities. Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can generate a much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam. Another interesting application is harmonic lasing self-seeding that allows to improve the longitudinal coherence and spectral power of a self-amplified spontaneous emission FEL. This concept was tested at the soft x-ray FEL user facility FLASH in the range of 4.5–15 nm and at Pohang accelerator laboratory X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) at 1 nm. In this paper we present recent results from the European XFEL where we successfully demonstrated harmonic lasing at 5.9 Angstrom and 2.8 Angstrom. In the latter case we obtained both third and fifth harmonic lasing and, for the first time, operated a harmonic lasing cascade (fifth-third-first harmonics of the undulator). These results pave the way for reaching very high photon energies, up to 100 keV.},

	abstract = {Harmonic lasing in a free electron laser with a planar undulator (under the condition that the fundamental frequency is suppressed) might be a cheap and efficient way of extension of wavelength ranges of existing and planned x-ray free electron laser (FEL) facilities. Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can provide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to handle due to the suppressed fundamental frequency. In this paper we perform a parametrization of the solution of the eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd harmonics, and present an explicit expression for FEL gain length, taking into account all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression of the fundamental harmonic. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing and lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth and to increase brilliance of x-ray beam at saturation. Considering 3rd harmonic lasing as a practical example, we come to the conclusion that it is much more robust than usually thought, and can be widely used in the existing or planned x-ray FEL (XFEL) facilities. In particular, Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) after a minor modification can lase to saturation at the 3rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25–30 keV providing multigigawatt power level and narrow bandwidth. As for the European XFEL, harmonic lasing would allow one to extend operating range (ultimately up to 100 keV), to reduce FEL bandwidth and to increase brilliance, to enable two-color operation for pump-probe experiments, and to provide more flexible operation at different electron energies. Similar improvements can be realized in other x-ray FEL facilities with gap-tunable undulators like FLASH II, SACLA, LCLS II, etc. Harmonic lasing can be an attractive option for compact x-ray FELs (driven by electron beams with a relatively low energy), allowing the use of the standard undulator technology instead of small-gap in-vacuum devices. Finally, in this paper we discover that in a part of the parameter space, corresponding to the operating range of soft x-ray beam lines of x-ray FEL facilities (like SASE3 beam line of the European XFEL), harmonics can grow faster than the fundamental wavelength. This feature can be used in some experiments, but might also be an unwanted phenomenon, and we discuss possible measures to diminish it.},

This undulator will allow pump-probe experiments where THz pulses are naturally synchronized to the VUV pulse from the FEL, as well as the development of novel electron-beam diagnostics techniques. Since the THz radiation diffraction-size exceeds the vacuum-chamber dimensions, characterization of infrared radiation must be performed accounting for the presence of a waveguide. We developed a theory of undulator radiation in a waveguide based on paraxial and resonance approximation. We solved the field equation with a tensor Green's function technique, and extracted figure of merits describing in a simple way the influence of the vacuum-pipe on the radiation pulse as a function of the problem parameters.

	abstract = {Many excitation mechanisms of matter resonate in the terahertz (THz) regime. Recent progress in the generation of intense THz radiation enables driving these excitations far out of equilibrium, providing the tools to decouple various degrees of freedom and their impact on materials’ properties. However, these sources are significantly limited in spectral tunability and efforts are ongoing to develop instrumentation for more versatile THz generation. This workshop was organized to obtain feedback from the THz community about the value of being able to generate and probe these out-of-equilibrium states with X-rays. Based on the scientific requirements and the present technological capabilities, this workshop concluded that laser-based sources are relatively inexpensive and have enabled novel experiments on specific sample systems, whereas only accelerator-based sources provide the wide tunability together with high intensity and repetition rates beyond 100 kHz, that will enable broad application at the European XFEL to the most interesting scientific problems in the field. Therefore, the suggested strategy, concluded during this workshop, is to follow two approaches simultaneously: 1) make available laser-based THz sources at every instrument at the European XFEL, based on the available pump–probe (PP) laser, and 2) evaluate two accelerator-based THz sources—one using the electron bunches from the main accelerator of the European XFEL and the other based on a separate accelerator—and ultimately develop and implement at least one of these accelerator-based sources},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel scheme for integrating a coherent THz source in the baseline of the LCLS facility. Any method relying on the spent electron beam downstream of the baseline undulator should provide a way of transporting the radiation up to the experimental floor. Here we propose to use the dump area access maze. In this way the THz output must propagate with limited size at least for one hundred meters in a maze, following many turns, to reach the near experimental hall. The use of a standard, discrete, open beam-waveguide formed by periodic reflectors, that is a mirror guide, would lead to unacceptable size of the system. To avoid these problems, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based on periodically spaced metallic screens with holes. This quasi-optical transmission line is referred to as an iris line. We present complete calculations for the iris line using both analytical and numerical methods, which we find in good agreement. We present a design of a THz edge radiation source based on the use of an iris line. The proposed setup takes almost no cost nor time to be implemented at the LCLS baseline, and can be used at other facilities as well. The edge radiation source is limited in maximally achievable field strength at the sample. An extension based on the use of an undulator in the presence of the iris line, which is feasible at the LCLS energies, is proposed as a possible upgrade of the baseline THz source.},

	abstract = {In electromagnetism, a dielectric (or dielectric material or dielectric medium) is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by an applied electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarisation. Because of dielectric polarisation, positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field (for example, if the field is moving parallel to the positive x axis, the negative charges will shift in the negative x direction). This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarised, but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials. Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in electronics, optics, solid-state physics and cell biophysics.},

	abstract = {We critically review the literature on the Debye absorption peak of liquid water and the excess response found on the high frequency side of the Debye peak. We find a lack of agreement on the microscopic phenomena underlying both of these features. To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we ran large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different distance-dependent decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra, finding that it involves processes that take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We also calculated the \$k\$-dependence of the Debye relaxation, finding it to be highly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate Debye relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of molecules after H-bond breaking. We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package for fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different ways of fitting the high frequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks. We propose using the generalized Lydanne-Sachs-Teller (gLST) equation as a way of testing the physicality of model dielectric functions. Our attempts at fitting the experimental spectrum using the gLST relation as a constraint indicate that the traditional way of fitting the excess response with secondary and tertiary Debye relaxations is problematic. All of our work is consistent with the recent theory of Popov et al. (2016) that Debye relaxation is due to the migration of Bjerrum-like defects in the hydrogen bond network. Under this theory, the mechanism of Debye relaxation in liquid water is similar to the mechanism in ice, but the heterogeneity and power-law dynamics of the H-bond network in water results in excess response on the high frequency side of the peak.},

We show that in the overlap region of the two methods it is possible to combine these views into a coherent concept of what drives the dynamic features of water. In this work, we develop the idea that the dielectric relaxation in water is driven by the migration of defects through the H-bond network, leading to a Debye-like peak in the lower frequencies. The deviation from the Debye law in the higher sub-THz frequencies is traced to a global fluctuation of the same H-bond network, clearly evident in the Raman Spectra. By incorporating these two views, a mathematical formalism is presented that can aptly explicate the dielectric spectra of liquid water.},

MLLs are deposited layer by layer, with their thicknesses following the zone plate law, and then pieces are sliced and extracted for use in focusing. Rays are reflected in the Laue geometry. The efficiency of a MLL can be very high, and is maximized by making the slice equal to about a half Pendellosung period so that most energy is transferred from the undiffracted to the diffracted beam, and by ensuring that the Bragg condition is met at each point in the zone plate. This latter condition requires that the layers are tilted to the beam by an amount that varies with layer position; e.g. for focusing a collimated beam, the layers should be normal to a cylinder of radius of twice the focal length. We have fabricated such tilted-zone MLLs and find that they exhibit improved efficiency across their entire pupil as compared with parallel-zone MLLs. This leads to a higher effective NA of the optic and hence higher resolution.},

A comprehensive and accurate analysis of the microwave power reflected from the surface of the sample is also carried out during microwave heating. The influence of sample length is studied using an original numerical procedure. The study highlights that 1D closed-form expressions can be extended to 2D configurations in the case of sufficiently high dielectric properties.

	abstract = {A theory is developed of image formation with an X-ray lens that consists of a large number of elements. Each element has a biconcave parabolic profile and weakly refracts an X-ray beam. Since such a lens can have a relatively large length comparable to the focal length, the thin-lens approximation is inapplicable. An exact expression for the propagator of a continuously refractive lens is derived that describes the transfer of radiation through a refractive parabolic medium. We calculate the image propagator that describes the focusing of a parallel beam and the image transfer (the focusing of a microobject), as well as the Fourier transform of the transmission function for a microobject with a lens, is calculated. The effective aperture of an X-ray lens is completely determined by the absorption of radiation and does not depend on its geometrical cross-sectional sizes. If we write the complex refractive index as n=1− δ+iβ, then the beam diameter at the focus is approximately a factor of 0.8β/δ smaller than the diameter of the effective aperture, with the index depending only slightly on the wavelength. A continuously refractive lens has no aberrations in the sense that all of the rays that passed through the lens aperture are focused at a single point. The lens can focus radiation inside it and has the properties of a waveguide; i.e., it can reconstruct the beam structure for some lengths to within the absorption-caused distortions. Nonuniform X-ray absorption in the lens leads to the interesting visualization effect of transparent microobjects when their image is focused. In this case, the phase shift gradient produced by the microobject is imaged. We discuss the properties of the Fourier transform pertaining to the absorption of radiation in the lens.},

	abstract = {The manufacture and properties of compound refractive lenses (CRLs) for hard X-rays with parabolic profile are described. These novel lenses can be used up to ∼60 keV. A typical focal length is 1 m. They have a geometrical aperture of 1 mm and are best adapted to undulator beams at synchrotron radiation sources. The transmission ranges from a few \% in aluminium CRLs up to about 30\% expected in beryllium CRLs. The gain (ratio of the intensity in the focal spot relative to the intensity behind a pinhole of equal size) is larger than 100 for aluminium and larger than 1000 for beryllium CRLs. Due to their parabolic profile they are free of spherical aberration and are genuine imaging devices. The theory for imaging an X-ray source and an object illuminated by it has been developed, including the effects of attenuation (photoabsorption and Compton scattering) and of the roughness at the lens surface. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment has been found. With aluminium CRLs a lateral resolution in imaging of 0.3 µm has been achieved and a resolution below 0.1 µm can be expected for beryllium CRLs. The main fields of application of the refractive X-ray lenses are (i) microanalysis with a beam in the micrometre range for diffraction, fluorescence, absorption, scattering; (ii) imaging in absorption and phase contrast of opaque objects which cannot tolerate sample preparation; (iii) coherent X-ray scattering.},

In cascaded High Gain Harmonic Generation (HGHG) FELs, harmonic radiation may be used to improve frequency-conversion and reduce the number of HGHG-stages. BESSY proposes to build a cascaded HGHG FEL with three FEL lines [1]. They cover a wavelength range of 51 nm (Low-Energy FEL) to 1.2 nm (High-Energy FEL) and consist of up to four HGHG-stages.

	abstract = {In most practical cases γ is very large; in practical units γ = 1957E [GeV]. Thus, when the
direction of motion is pointing towards the observer within a small angle∼1/γ there is a very
strong time compression effect of the order 1/2γ 2. An alternative method to arrive at the
same result was given in Chapter 2 (Eqn (5)). The apparent acceleration of the electron seen
by the observer, which according to Eqn (19) of Chapter 2 is proportional to the electric ﬁeld
of the received radiation, is therefore enhanced by a large factor. This fact has an implication
both for the frequency spectrum of the received radiation as well as the angular distribution.
Due to this process the radiation received in a given direction is effectively emitted only over
a small arc of the trajectory ∼2ρ/γ , where ρ is the radius of curvature of the trajectory, and
hence over a time∼2ρ/cγ . However, due to the relative motion of the electrons and emitted
photons the observer receives a pulse shortened by a factor∼1/2γ 2 and therefore of duration
-t ∼ ρ/cγ 3. Using general arguments about Fourier transforms it can be seen that a pulse
of this duration will contain frequency components up to about ωtyp whereωtyp ∼ 1
-t∼
(
cρ)
γ 3It can be seen therefore that the frequency is increased by a large factor γ 3 compared to the
angular frequency of rotation of the electron ω0 = c/ρ. For example, a 1GeV electron in
a 1 T ﬁeld has a radius of curvature of 3.3m and hence an angular frequency of 90MHz,
corresponding to a wavelength of 20m. The radiation frequency however is much larger,
6.7 × 1017 Hz with a corresponding wavelength of 28Å. The great difference between the
typical radiation frequency and the frequency of orbital motion was ﬁrst appreciated by
Schwinger [10] who explained why synchrotron radiation was able to be seen in the visible
region of the spectrum rather than in the microwave region where it had ﬁrst been expected.
Equation (1) also shows that the time compression depends strongly on the angle of obser-vation in the vertical plane, implying therefore that the majority of the radiation is conﬁned
within a small vertical angle of the order∼1/γ . In the horizontal plane, on the other hand, the
deﬂection angle in the bending magnet is usually much larger than this, and so the emission
is effectively independent of horizontal angle.},

	abstract = {The chapter presents a study on synchrotron radiation sources. Synchrotron radiation is a very bright, broadband, polarized, and a pulsed source of light extending from the infrared to the x-ray region. It is an extremely important source of vacuum ultraviolet radiation. Synchrotron radiation covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the infrared region through the visible, ultraviolet, and into the x-ray region up to energies of many tens of kilovolts. In electron storage rings, there are the following three possible sources of synchrotron radiation: dipole (bending) magnets; wigglers, which act like a sequence of bending magnets with alternating polarities; and undulators, which are also multiperiod alternating magnet systems but in which the beam deflections are small, resulting in coherent interference of the emitted light. The theory describing synchrotron radiation emission is based on classical electrodynamics. The most important characteristic of accelerators built specifically as synchrotron radiation sources is that they have a magnetic focusing system, which is designed to concentrate the electrons into bunches of very small cross section and to keep the electron transverse velocities small. The chapter presents a discussion on the concept of fourth-generation sources, which have high brightness, and are based on multiparticle coherence. The chapter presents a phenomenological description in order to highlight the general concepts involved.},

	abstract = {While twisted photons with orbital angular momentum can be generated in several ways, their massive counterparts – vortex electrons, neutrons, or atoms – can be obtained so far only via diﬀraction techniques, not applicable for relativistic energies. Here we show that particles with phase vortices, including hadrons, ions, and nuclei, can be generated during emission in helical undulators, via Cherenkov radiation, in collisions with intense laser beams, in such scattering and annihilation processes as eµ → eµ, ep → ep, etc. We elucidate that the key element in obtaining them is not the process itself but the post-selection protocol due to quantum entanglement. A ﬁnal particle acquires a phase vortex if the other ﬁnal particle’s momentum is weakly measured with no post-selection of its azimuthal angle. This technique can be used for generating all types of vortex particles, it can be adapted for ultrarelativistic beams of modern colliders for hadronic and spin studies, and it can also facilitate the development of sources of hard X-ray and γ-range twisted photons.},

An important quantity in this approach is the Wigner distribution of the electric fields, which can be interpreted as a phase-space distribution of photon flux, and thus can be identified with the brightness. When integrated over the angular variables, the brightness becomes the intensity distribution in the spatial variables and when integrated over the spatial variables, it becomes the intensity distribution in angular variables. The brightness so defined transforms through a general optical medium in exactly the same way as in the case of a collection of geometric rays. Finally, the brightness of different electrons adds in a simple way.

	volume = {3},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15014373},
	abstract = {Synchrotron Radiation (SR) has been widely used since the 80's as a tool for many applications of UV, soft X rays and hard X rays in condensed matter physics, chemistry and biology. The evolution of SR sources towards higher brightness has led to the design of low-emittance electron storage rings (emittance is the product of beam size and divergence), and the development of special source magnetic structures, as undulators. This means that more and more photons are available on a narrow bandwidth and on a small collimated beam; in other words there is the possibility of getting a high power in a coherent beam. In most applications, a monochromator is used, and the temporal coherence of the light is given by the monochromator bandwidth. With smaller and smaller sources, even without the use of collimators, the spatial coherence of the light has become appreciable, first in the UV and soft X ray range, and then also with hard X rays. This has made possible new or improved experiments in interferometry, microscopy, holography, correlation spectroscopy, etc. In view of these recent possibilities and applications, it is useful to review some basic concepts about spatial coherence of SR, and its measurement and applications. In particular we show how the spatial coherence properties of the radiation in the far field can be calculated with simple operations from the single-electron amplitude and the electron beam angular and position spreads. The gaussian approximation will be studied in detail for a discussion of the properties of the far field mutual coherence and the estimate of the coherence widths, and the comparison with the VanCittert-Zernike limit.},

	abstract = {The generation of attosecond, highbrightness x-ray pulses is a matter of great interest given their applications in the study of ultra-fast processes. In recent years, the production of x-ray pulses of high brightness, both in the soft and in the hard x-ray range, has been enabled by x-ray freeelectron lasers (XFELs). In contrast to conventional quantum lasers, XFELs are based on the use of an ultra-relativistic electron beam as gain medium. They often work in the self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE) regime, which provides pulses of duration down to a few femtoseconds, composed of several longitudinal modes. In order to further decrease the duration of these pulses, special methods need to be implemented. In this paper we review available methods, with particular focus on the x-ray laser-enhanced attosecond pulse generation, which is one of the most promising techniques. We illustrate the method using the SASE3 soft x-ray undulator of the European XFEL facility as a case study, emphasizing the importance of highrepetition rate attosecond x-ray pulses. The expected attosecond-level radiation output is used for simulations of sequential ionization processes in atoms in the case of ionization in the soft x-ray regime, demonstrating the importance of this opportunity for the user community.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603269},
	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the image formation problem for undulator radiation through an optical system, accounting for the inﬂuence of the electron beam emittance. On the one hand, image formation with Synchrotron Radiation is governed by the laws of Statistical Optics. On the other hand, the widely used GaussianShell model cannot be applied to describe the coherence properties of X-ray beams from third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required. We propose a technique to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source, that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system. At ﬁrst we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non-limiting pupil aperture. Our theory, which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, also allows treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their applicability region. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, which is relevant for third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. First principle calculations of undulator radiation characteristics (i.e. ten-dimensional integrals) are then reduced to one-dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions speciﬁc for undulator radiation sources. We also consider the imaging problem for a non-ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture, which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three. In particular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observation plane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and the intensity from an ideal lens. Our results may be used in practical cases as well as in benchmarks for numerical methods.},

However, after having spent a number of years, both in relativistic engineering and research with relativity, I have come to the conclusion that there exist a place for a new book. I do believe that the present book is not quite the same as the others, mainly due to attempt to cast light on dark corners. I should make it clear what this little book is not. It is not a textbook on relativity theory. What the book is about is the nature of special relativistic kinematics, its relation to space and time, and the operational interpretation of coordinate transformations. Every theory contains a number of quantities that can be measured by experiment and an expressions that cannot possibly be observed. Whenever we have a theory containing an arbitrary convention, we should examine what parts of the theory depend on the choice of that convention and what parts do not. The distinction is not always made and many authors claim some data to be observable, according to arbitrary conventions, which do not correspond to any physical experiment. This leads to inconsistencies and paradoxes that should be avoided at all cost.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09276v1},
	abstract = {Vector field analysis is presented for a highly overmoded iris-line structure that can act as a medium of transportation for THz radiation. The axisymmetric structure is capable of supporting hybrid modes with desirable features such as low propagation loss, uniformly linear polarization and approximately-Gaussian intensity profile across the iris. A specific application that can benefit from these features is the transportation of THz undulator radiation over hundreds of meters to reach the experimental halls at the LCLS facility, SLAC, Stanford. Such a structure has been modelled before as a boundary-value problem using Vainstein's impedance boundary condition and assuming infinitely-thin screens. Given that physical realizations of such screens must have finite thickness and that the THz wavelength in the 3-15 THz range is expected to be smaller than convenient screen thicknesses in practice, the question of the impact of finite screen thickness on propagation performance becomes rather pressing. To address this question, we present a mode-matching analysis of the structure, with finite screen thickness and perturbatively clustered (localized) field expansions, for computational feasibility. The effect of screen thickness is seen to lower the attenuation constant on the iris line, which is dominated by diffraction loss. The propagation loss predictions based on the Vainstein-model are compared with the numerical results from mode-matching for infinitely-thin screens, where the former method is observed to agree with the numerical results better at higher Fresnel numbers (highly-overmoded structures). The properties of the dominant mode fields are formally derived from first principles and a recommended approach is discussed for the inclusion of screen-thickness effects into propagation loss estimations.},

	abstract = {Self-seeding is a promising approach to signiﬁcantly narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. The implementation of this method in the soft X-ray wavelength range necessarily involves gratings as dispersive elements. We study a very compact self-seeding scheme with a grating monochromator originally designed at SLAC, which can be straightforwardly installed in the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a ﬁxed incidence angle mounting without entrance slit. It covers the spectral range from 300 eV to 1000 eV. The optical system was studied using wave optics method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performance of the self-seeding scheme. Our wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations, and errors from each optical element. Wave optics is the only method available, in combination with FEL simulations, for the design of a self-seeding monochromator without exit slit. We show that, without exit slit, the self-seeding scheme is distinguished by the much needed experimental simplicity, and can practically give the same resolving power (about 7000) as with an exit slit. Wave optics is also naturally applicable to calculations of the self-seeding scheme eﬃciency, which include the monochromator transmittance and the eﬀect of the mismatching between seed beam and electron beam. Simulations show that the FEL power reaches 1 TW and that the spectral density for a TW pulse is about two orders of magnitude higher than that for the SASE pulse at saturation.},

Then, the brightness includes information on both coherence and wavefront characteristics of the radiation field. For undulator sources, it is customary to approximate the single-electron electric field at resonance with a Gaussian beam, leading to great simplifications. Attempts to account for the modified spatial and angular profile of the undulator radiation in the presence of detuning due to energy spread, currently build on the simplified brightness expression derived under the assumption of Gaussian beams. The influence of energy spread on undulator radiation properties is becoming important in view of diffraction-limited rings with ultralow emittance coming on-line. Here the effects of energy spread on the brightness of undulator radiation at resonance are discussed, as well as relevant relations with coherence properties.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01664052},
	abstract = {The context of this thesis is the study of the partial coherence in synchrotron beams produced by ultra low emittance storage rings, like the ESRF-EBS ring under construction. As main objectives we had the understanding, application and development of the underlying physics and the implementation of computer tools able to calculate the relevant parameters.In the first part of this thesis we develop a theory for statistical optics for storage ring radiation. It is based on the brightness convolution theorem by Kim and on the subtle but very important theoretical contributions from Geloni et al. We derive their formulas in a slightly different way or in more a detailed form.We emphasize the importance of the description of the electron beam stochastic for the coherence properties of storage ring emission. We observe that for weak coupling of the longitudinal electron position to the other beam parameters the bunch length is a free parameter in view of coherence properties.We build our description of statistical optics around coherent modes. We show that an ensemble is completely coherent if and only if its coherent mode decomposition is a single mode. Geloni et al. mentioned that the synchrotron storage ring emission is a Gaussian random process. We add that the process has zero mean and is circularly-symmetric. In consequence we can give the spectral degree of coherence a physical interpretation in terms of Gaussian shaped conditional probability densities.We developed and implemented an algorithm that calculates the coherent mode decomposition of the cross spectral density for a given wavelength. It can be applied to electron beams with finite Twiss alpha and with energy spread. We implemented two algorithms. The first version solves the Fredholm equation in a two-dimensional step function basis set. Because of its memory requirements high undulator harmonics or current lattices with high emittances cannot be calculated. To reduce the memory requirements we developed the two-step method that solves the problem first for an electron beam with zero divergence and adds the effects of the divergence in a second step. The algorithms use the eigensolver library SLEPc. The implementations of the algorithms are open source.We present extensive tests of the algorithms. They include a delta-function shaped electron beam, a Gaussian single electron reference electric field, whose results are analytically known, and comparisons to SRW Monte Carlo samplings.We apply the algorithm to some particular cases. We determine how many modes are necessary to incorporate 95\% of the spectral density and how the spectral degree of coherence changes. We find that the energy spread adds extra coherent modes. This effect is negligible for current lattices but for the ESRF-EBS lattice it accounts for a significant fraction of the total modes. Shorter undulators and higher harmonics increase the number of modes. A comparison between an undulator placed at a point with finite alpha and at a symmetry point shows no significant differences. A reduction of the ESRF-EBS beam parameters show a decrease of the mode numbers until they reach a single mode. We simulate a simple 1:1 imaging beamline with an aperture in the image plane. A reduction of the aperture size changes the eigenvalue spectrum to fewer and fewer modes that is paid with a decrease of flux. We present a comparison of the calculated cross spectral density with a Gaussian Schell-model, an analytic approximation and a separation approximation. Although there are not negligible errors between the exact calculation and the separation approximation we come to the conclusions that the separation approximation might be a good and quick approximation that allows the calculation on portable computers.We end the thesis with some ideas for future research.},

	abstract = {X-ray beamlines in modern synchrotron radiation sources make extensive use of grazing-incidence reflective optics, in particular Kirkpatrick–Baez elliptical mirror systems. These systems can focus the incoming X-rays down to nanometer-scale spot sizes while maintaining relatively large acceptance apertures and high flux in the focused radiation spots. In low-emittance storage rings and in free-electron lasers such systems are used with partially or even nearly fully coherent X-ray beams and often target diffraction-limited resolution. Therefore, their accurate simulation and modeling has to be performed within the framework of wave optics. Here the implementation and benchmarking of a wave-optics method for the simulation of grazing-incidence mirrors based on the local stationary-phase approximation or, in other words, the local propagation of the radiation electric field along geometrical rays, is described. The proposed method is CPU-efficient and fully compatible with the numerical methods of Fourier optics. It has been implemented in the

	abstract = {Exploiting the coherence properties in the hard X-ray regime is an important topic for the emerging ultra-lowemittance synchrotron storage rings. The Coherent Hard X-ray (CHX) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is exploiting the coherent flux to enable best-in-class time-resolved coherent scattering techniques such as X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) or X-ray Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy (XSVS). Based on the commissioning results, a realistic simulation of the whole beamline, including source and optics, has been performed leveraging a ‘virtual beamline’ module of the ‘Synchrotron Radiation Workshop’ (SRW) code in a web browser based interface to the code named ‘Sirepo’. This virtual beamline capability is used here to simulate partially coherent small angle scattering patterns of samples relevant to the CHX science case, mimicking ‘detector images’ of real experiments. Such source-to-detector simulations of experiments allow for an accurate estimation of feasibility of a given experiment, for an optimization of the beamline setup and interpretation of experimental results.},

	abstract = {Partially-coherent wavefront propagation calculations have proven to be feasible and very beneficial in the design of beamlines for 3rd and 4th generation Synchrotron Radiation (SR) sources. These types of calculations use the framework of classical electrodynamics for the description, on the same accuracy level, of the emission by relativistic electrons moving in magnetic fields of accelerators, and the propagation of the emitted radiation wavefronts through beamline optical elements. This enables accurate prediction of performance characteristics for beamlines exploiting high SR brightness and/or high spectral flux. Detailed analysis of radiation degree of coherence, offered by the partially-coherent wavefront propagation method, is of paramount importance for modern storage-ring based SR sources, which, thanks to extremely small sub-nanometer-level electron beam emittances, produce substantial portions of coherent flux in X-ray spectral range. We describe the general approach to partially-coherent SR wavefront propagation simulations and present examples of such simulations performed using "Synchrotron Radiation Workshop" (SRW) code for the parameters of hard X-ray undulator based beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven National Laboratory. These examples illustrate general characteristics of partially-coherent undulator radiation beams in lowemittance SR sources, and demonstrate advantages of applying high-accuracy physical-optics simulations to the optimization and performance prediction of X-ray optical beamlines in these new sources.},

Importantly, the numerically retrieved sets of pulses reproduce the experimentally accessible FEL light characteristics as measured at the Free-electron LASer at Hamburg (FLASH), such as the average spectrum, single-shot spectral shape, and pulse duration. The high-precision agreement with the experimental average spectral shape, without further knowledge of FEL machine parameters, makes this approach a convenient tool for the analysis and theoretical modeling of nonlinear optical or pump\&\#x2013;probe experiments with FEL light.},

Ideal CRLs have long been made available in the ’Synchrotron Radiation Workshop’ (SRW), however, the current context requires more sophisticated modelling of X-ray lenses. In this work, we revisit the already implemented wave-optics model for an ideal X-ray lens in the projection approximation and propose modiﬁcations to it as to allow more degrees of freedom to both the front and back surfaces independently, which enables to reproduce misalignments and manufacturing errors commonly found in X-ray lenses. For the cases where simply tilting and transversely oﬀsetting the parabolic sections of a CRL is not enough, we present the possibility of generating the ﬁgure errors by using Zernike and Legendre polynomials or directly adding metrology data to the lenses. We present the eﬀects of each new degree of freedom by calculating their impact on point spread function and the beam caustics.},

	abstract = {Typically, in Self-Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission Free Electron Laser (SASE FEL) based short-pulse schemes, pulse duration is limited by FEL coherence time. For hard X-ray FELs, coherence time is in a few hundred attosecond range while for XUV and soft X-ray FELs it is in the femtosecond regime. In this paper the modiﬁcation of so-called chirp-taper scheme is developed that allows to overcome the coherence time barrier. Numerical simulations for XUV and soft X-ray FEL user facility FLASH demonstrate that one can generate a few hundred attosecond long pulses in the wavelength range 2 - 10 nm with peak power reaching hundreds of megawatts. With several thousand pulses per second this can be a unique source for attosecond science.},

In this paper, we explore the basics of random fields and the multiple comparisons on the random fields, which are necessary to properly threshold statistical maps for the whole image at specific statistical significance level. The multiple comparisons are crucial in determining overall statistical significance in correlated test statistics over the whole brain. In practice, t- or F-statistics in adjacent voxels are correlated. So there is the problem of multiple comparisons, which we have simply neglected up to now. For multiple comparisons that account for spatially correlated test statistics, various methods were proposed: Bonferroni correction, random field theory, false discovery rates and permutation tests. Among them, we will explore the random field approach.},

A Brownian path is continuous but nowhere diﬀerentiable, and this non-smoothness is associated with technical complications that can be daunting. However, there is another approach to random processes that is more elementary, involving smooth random functions deﬁned by ﬁnite Fourier series with random coeﬃcients, or equivalently, by trigonometric polynomial interpolation through random data values. We show here how smooth random functions can provide a very practical way to explore random eﬀects. For example, one can solve smooth random ordinary diﬀerential equations using standard mathematical deﬁnitions and numerical algorithms, rather than having to develop new deﬁnitions and algorithms of stochastic diﬀerential equations. In the limit as the number of Fourier coeﬃcients deﬁning a smooth random function goes to ∞, one obtains the usual stochastic objects in what is known as their Stratonovich interpretation.},

	abstract = {The usual way that mathematicians work with randomness is by a rigorous formulation of the idea of Brownian motion, which is the limit of a random walk as the step length goes to zero. A Brownian path is continuous but nowhere diﬀerentiable, and this non-smoothness is associated with technical complications that can be daunting. However, there is another approach to random processes that is more elementary, involving smooth random functions deﬁned by ﬁnite Fourier series with random coeﬃcients, or equivalently, by trigonometric polynomial interpolation through random data values. We show here how smooth random functions can provide a very practical way to explore random eﬀects. For example, one can solve smooth random ordinary diﬀerential equations using standard mathematical deﬁnitions and numerical algorithms, rather than having to develop new deﬁnitions and algorithms of stochastic diﬀerential equations. In the limit as the number of Fourier coeﬃcients deﬁning a smooth random function goes to ∞, one obtains the usual stochastic objects in what is known as their Stratonovich interpretation.},

	abstract = {This work contains a systematic treatment of single particle Synchrotron Radiation and some application to realistic beams with given cross section area, divergence and energy spread. Standard theory relies on several approximations whose applicability limits and accuracy are often forgotten. We begin remarking that on the one hand, a paraxial approximation can always be applied without loss of generality and with ultra relativistic accuracy. On the other hand, dominance of the acceleration field over the velocity part in the Lienard-Wiechert expressions is not always granted and constitutes a separate assumption, whose applicability is discussed. Treating Synchrotron Radiation in paraxial approximation we derive the equation for the slow varying envelope function of the Fourier components of the electric field vector. Calculations of Synchrotron Radiation properties performed by others showed that the phase of the Fourier components of the electric field vector differs from the phase of a virtual point source. In this paper we present a systematic, analytical description of this phase shift, calculating amplitude and phase of electric field from bending magnets, short magnets, two bending magnet system separated by a straight section (edge radiation) and undulator devices. We pay particular attention to region of applicability and accuracy of approximations used. Finally, taking advantage of results of analytical calculation presented in reduced form we analyze various features of radiation from a complex insertion device (set of two undulators with a focusing triplet in between) accounting for the influence of energy spread and electron beam emittance.},

	abstract = {We propose a concept for production of high power coherent attosecond pulses in X-ray range. An approach is based on generation of eighth harmonic of radiation in a multistage HGHG FEL (high gain high harmonic free electron laser) conﬁguration starting from shot noise. Single-spike phenomena occurs when electron bunch is passed through the sequence of four relatively short undulators. The ﬁrst stage is a conventional ‘‘long’’ wavelength (0.8 nm) SASE FEL which operates in the high-gain linear regime. The 0.1 nm wavelength range is reached by successive multiplication (0.8 ! 0.4 ! 0.2 ! 0.1 nm) in a stage sequence. Our study shows that the statistical properties of the high-harmonic radiation from the SASE FEL, operating in linear regime, can be used for selection of radiation pulses with a single spike in time domain. The duration of the spikes is in the range of 400–600 attoseconds. Selection of single-spike highharmonic pulses is achieved by using a special trigger in data acquisition system. The potential of X-ray SASE FEL at TESLA at DESY for generating attosecond pulses is demonstrated. Since the design of XFEL laboratory at TESLA is based on the use of long SASE undulators with tunable gap, no special place nor additional FEL undulators are required for attophysics experiments. The use of a 10 GW-level attosecond X-ray pulses at X-ray SASE FEL facility will enable us to track process inside atoms for the ﬁrst time.},

The 15 GeV electron trajectory within the undulator must be straight to \&5 m over a gain length of 11 m so that the photon beam overlaps e\$ciently with the electron beam. This alignment precision is not achievable with available mechanical survey methods. For this reason, an empirical beam-based alignment technique is developed that uses BPM readings in conjuntion with large, deliberate variations in the electron energy. We describe here a detailed alignment simulation including BPM and magnet-mover calibration errors, quadrupole gradient errors, and dipole "eld errors which demonstrate that the alignment can be achieved with high con"dence. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Undulator commissioning, which refers to the tuning and alignment processes to eliminate the possible error sources, is thus an important step toward realization of lasing. In the SPring-8 angstrom compact free electron laser (SACLA) facility, the undulator commissioning has been carried out by means of characterization of x-ray radiation, i.e., measurements of the spatial and spectral profiles of monochromatized spontaneous undulator radiation as well as by probing the FEL intensity. The achieved tuning and alignment accuracies estimated from the statistics of actual measurements in SACLA show the effectiveness of this commissioning scheme.},

Here we show a new light source of a two-colour double-pulse (TCDP) XFEL in hard X-rays using variable-gap undulators, which realizes a large and flexible wavelength separation of more than 30\% with an ultraprecisely controlled time interval in the attosecond regime. Together with sub-10-fs pulse duration and multi-gigawatt peak powers, the TCDP scheme enables us to elucidate X-ray-induced ultrafast transitions of electronic states and structures, which will significantly contribute to the advancement of ultrafast chemistry, plasma and astronomical physics, and quantum X-ray optics.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a scheme for pump-probe experiments that can be performed at LCLS and at the European XFEL and determines what additional hardware development will be required to bring these experiments to fruition. It is proposed to derive both pump and probe pulses from the same electron bunch, but from different parts of the tunable-gap baseline undulator. This eliminates the need for synchronization and cancels jitter problems. The method has the further advantage to make a wide frequency range accessible at high peak-power and high repetition-rate. An important feature of the proposed scheme is that the hardware requirement is minimal. Our technique is based in essence on the "fresh" bunch technique. For its implementation it is sufficient to substitute a single undulator module with short magnetic delay line, i.e. a weak magnetic chicane, which delays the electron bunch with respect to the SASE pulse of half of the bunch length in the linear stage of amplification. This installation does not perturb the baseline mode of operation. We present a feasibility study and we make exemplifications with the parameters of the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.},

In this work we discuss the possibility of applying a simple and cost-effective method for producing two-color pulses at the SASE3 soft X-ray beamline of the European XFEL.

The free-electron laser process at LCLS is based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) where spontaneous emission from the initial electron beam shot noise is amplified by its interaction with the electrons over a long magnetic undulator. Although SASE is very effective, producing
tremendously powerful, ultrashort X-ray beams, the start-up from noise leaves poor temporal coherence and a broad, noisy spectrum. We present experimental results of a new method, suggested by colleagues at DESY, allowing self-seeding using X-rays from the first half of the undulator to seed the second half through a diamond-based monochromator, producing near Fourier-transform-limited X-ray pulses with 0.4-0.5 eV bandwidth at 8-9 keV.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2743},
	abstract = {The most promising way to increase the output power of an X-ray FEL (XFEL) is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator. Also, significant increase in power is achievable by starting the FEL process from a monochromatic seed rather than from noise. This report proposes to make use of a cascade self-seeding scheme with wake monochromators in a tunable-gap baseline undulator at the European XFEL to create a source capable of delivering coherent radiation of unprecedented characteristics at hard X-ray wavelengths. Compared with SASE X-ray FEL parameters, the radiation from the new source has three truly unique aspects: complete longitudinal and transverse coherence, and a peak brightness three orders of magnitude higher than what is presently available at LCLS. Additionally, the new source will generate hard X-ray beam at extraordinary peak (TW) and average (kW) power level. The proposed source can thus revolutionize fields like single biomolecule imaging, inelastic scattering and nuclear resonant scattering. The self-seeding scheme with the wake monochromator is extremely compact, and takes almost no cost and time to be implemented. The upgrade proposed in this paper could take place during the commissioning stage of the European XFEL, opening a vast new range of applications from the very beginning of operations. We present feasibility study and examplifications for the SASE2 line of the European XFEL.},

However, high-repetition rate is expected to allow for unprecedented output characteristics. A two-chicane HXRSS setup is found to be optimal for the European XFEL.

	abstract = {Typical SASE XFEL pulses exhibit poor longitudinal coherence, a characteristic inherited from the start-up from shot noise. Self-seeding schemes are an answer to the call for improved longitudinal coherence. If applied to already working or designed XFELs, these schemes are subject to constraints, including minimal change to the baseline design, and possibility to recover the baseline mode of operation. In this work we propose a novel single-bunch self-seeding method, based on a particular kind of monochromator that satisfies these constraints. We will limit ourselves to the analysis of the simplest possible configuration, consisting of an input undulator and an output undulator, separated by our novel monochromatization stage. Such a stage consists of a weak few-meter long chicane, acting as a tunable delay stage, washing out the electron beam microbunching, and creating a transverse offset for the monochromator. In essence, the monochromator consists of a single crystal in Bragg-transmission geometry, which operates as a bandstop filter for the transmitted X-ray SASE radiation pulse. When the incident angle and the spectral contents of the incoming beam satisfy the Bragg diffraction condition, the temporal waveform of the transmitted radiation pulse shows a long monochromatic tail, whose duration is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the absorption line in the transmittance spectrum. The magnetic chicane is tuned to shift the electron bunch on top of the monochromatic wake created by the bandstop filter thus selecting (temporal windowing) a part of the wake. By this, the electron bunch is seeded with a radiation pulse characterized by a bandwidth much narrower than the natural FEL bandwidth. The output power from our setup can be further increased by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator, yielding a tremendous increase in peak brightness with respect to the baseline mode of operation. In this work we present a feasibility study and exemplifications for the LCLS, and we discuss advantages of our method compared to other self-seeding techniques.},

Statistical theory shows that the PSD of mid-spatial frequency defects in large optics approximately equals the weighted average of that in every subregion. Simulation and experiment demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. The proposed statistical method is not sensitive to the translation stage's error and thus is more appropriate for measurement of the mid-spatial frequency defects of large optics than the traditional sub-aperture stitching interferometry.},

	abstract = {This work contains a systematic treatment of single particle Synchrotron Radiation and some application to realistic beams with given cross section area, divergence and energy spread. Standard theory relies on several approximations whose applicability limits and accuracy are often forgotten. We begin remarking that on the one hand, a paraxial approximation can always be applied without loss of generality and with ultra relativistic accuracy. On the other hand, dominance of the acceleration field over the velocity part in the Lienard-Wiechert expressions is not always granted and constitutes a separate assumption, whose applicability is discussed. Treating Synchrotron Radiation in paraxial approximation we derive the equation for the slow varying envelope function of the Fourier components of the electric field vector. Calculations of Synchrotron Radiation properties performed by others showed that the phase of the Fourier components of the electric field vector differs from the phase of a virtual point source. In this paper we present a systematic, analytical description of this phase shift, calculating amplitude and phase of electric field from bending magnets, short magnets, two bending magnet system separated by a straight section (edge radiation) and undulator devices. We pay particular attention to region of applicability and accuracy of approximations used. Finally, taking advantage of results of analytical calculation presented in reduced form we analyze various features of radiation from a complex insertion device (set of two undulators with a focusing triplet in between) accounting for the influence of energy spread and electron beam emittance.},

	abstract = {A new set of baseline parameters of the electron beam and undulator for the European XFEL project has been deﬁned recently. Changes refer to the electron beam emittance, charge, operation at different electron energies, and change of undulator period. According to the present concept, it is planned to vary charge from 20 pC to 1 nC allowing control of the FWHM radiation pulse duration. Operation at different electron energies of 17.5 GeV, 14 GeV, and 10.5 GeV will allow extension of the wavelength range to longer wavelengths. Electron bunches with different charges possess different properties. These features have an inmpact on photon beam properties which should be taken into account at the design stage optical beamlines and instruments and planning user experiments. In this note we present an overview of the radiation properties generated by SASE FEL radiators driven by electron beam with revised baseline parameters.},

Then, the brightness includes information on both coherence and wavefront characteristics of the radiation field. For undulator sources, it is customary to approximate the single-electron electric field at resonance with a Gaussian beam, leading to great simplifications. Attempts to account for the modified spatial and angular profile of the undulator radiation in the presence of detuning due to energy spread currently build on the simplified brightness expression derived under the assumption of Gaussian beams. The influence of energy spread on undulator radiation properties is becoming important in view of diffraction-limited rings with ultralow emittance coming on-line. Here we discuss the effects of energy spread on the brightness of undulator radiation at resonance, as well as relevant relations with coherence properties.},

	title = {Brightness of synchrotron radiation from wigglers},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2648},
	abstract = {According to literature, while calculating the brightness of synchrotron radiation from wigglers, one needs to account for the so called `depth-of-field' effects. In fact, the particle beam cross section varies along the wiggler. It is usually stated that the effective photon source size increases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. Here we claim that this is a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based on geometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. According to electrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate this statement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-known first-principle computer code. This fact shows that under the usually accepted approximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to be inconsistent even qualitatively. Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined procedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. We accomplish this task based on the use of a Wigner function formalism. In the geometrical optics limit computations can be performed analytically. Within this limit, we restrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which is typical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the X-ray wavelength range. We give a direct demonstration of the fact that the apparent horizontal source size is broadened in proportion to the beamline opening angle and to the length of the wiggler. While this effect is well-understood, a direct proof appears not to have been given elsewhere. We consider the problem of the calculation of the wiggler source size by means of numerical simulations alone, which play the same role of an experiment. We report a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations and approximations currently used in literature.},

The simulation of GSM exactly describes the beam for all modes are included, but the amount of calculation of GSM is very great. While CMD is an easy to comprehend and more convenient approach but the simulated beam should be highly coherent for modes number can not be large. In previous simulation, modes with a contribution of less than 0.01 were neglected, but our simulation results demonstrate that the ratio 0.01 should goes down to 0.001, then CMD can exactly simulates the beam properties.},

	abstract = {We consider the maximum of the Wigner distribution (WD) of synchrotron radiation (SR) fields as a possible definition of SR source brightness. Such figure of merit was originally introduced in the SR community by Kim. The brightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometrical optics limit, can be interpreted as maximum density of photon flux in phase space. For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the WD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with a finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of a single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons in phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and electron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction angle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are intermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam divergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach is still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once more the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate regimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations and the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. We extend the WD formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a bending magnet. We find that in the intermediate regimes the usually accepted approximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent even parametrically.},

	title = {Brightness of synchrotron radiation from wigglers},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2648},
	abstract = {According to literature, while calculating the brightness of synchrotron radiation from wigglers, one needs to account for the so called `depth-of-field' effects. In fact, the particle beam cross section varies along the wiggler. It is usually stated that the effective photon source size increases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. Here we claim that this is a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based on geometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. According to electrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate this statement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-known first-principle computer code. This fact shows that under the usually accepted approximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to be inconsistent even qualitatively. Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined procedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. We accomplish this task based on the use of a Wigner function formalism. In the geometrical optics limit computations can be performed analytically. Within this limit, we restrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which is typical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the X-ray wavelength range. We give a direct demonstration of the fact that the apparent horizontal source size is broadened in proportion to the beamline opening angle and to the length of the wiggler. While this effect is well-understood, a direct proof appears not to have been given elsewhere. We consider the problem of the calculation of the wiggler source size by means of numerical simulations alone, which play the same role of an experiment. We report a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations and approximations currently used in literature.},

	url = {https://bib-pubdb1.desy.de/record/275967},
	abstract = {The emergence of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. FELs operating in the X-ray range (XFEL) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most of the natural sciences would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is the baseline FEL operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an FEL process until it reaches saturation. The SASE FEL radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other side, longitudinal coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs significantly in order to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization in the middle of an FEL amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the LCLS, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range.Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding (SXRSS) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded FEL simulations along with (in our case) GENESIS simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the LCLS self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the SXRSS monochromator design developed in SLAC was adapted for the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL.The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element.The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of \$300-1200\${\textasciitilde}eV providing resolving power above \$ 7000 \$. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the self-seeded European XFEL performance with a proposed SXRSS monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a TW-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional SASE pulse at saturation. Serkez, Svitozar},

	abstract = {This paper describes a theory of transverse coherence properties of Undulator Radiation. Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific predictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of the beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume that the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or generalized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field approximation. The VCZ theorem is derived in the frame of Statistical Optics using a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneous assumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situations regarding undulator sources. We propose a technique to calculate the cross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. Also, we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and we present an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is valid up to the exit of the undulator. For the case of more general undulator sources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated from numerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found. Finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherence properties of an X-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherent spot-size on a sample. This invention was devised almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.},

Current estimations of coherence properties often assume that undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem for calculating the degree of transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third generation light sources, because the vertical(geometrical) emittance of the electron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength in a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from 0.1 Angstrom up to 10{\textasciicircum}3 Angstrom). Sometimes, the so-called Gaussian-Schell model, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description of partially-coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to the quasi-homogeneous model. However, as we will demonstrate, this model fails to properly describe coherent properties of X-ray beams from non-homogeneous undulator sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. We propose a technique, based on statistical optics and Fourier optics, to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in the most general case, at any position after the undulator. Our theory, that makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their region of applicability. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. This case is practically relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.},

An important quantity in this approach is the Wigner distribution of the electric fields, which can be interpreted as a phase-space distribution of photon flux, and thus can be identified with the brightness. When integrated over the angular variables, the brightness becomes the intensity distribution in the spatial variables and when integrated over the spatial variables, it becomes the intensity distribution in angular variables. The brightness so defined transforms through a general optical medium in exactly the same way as in the case of a collection of geometric rays. Finally, the brightness of different electrons adds in a simple way. Optical characteristics of various synchrotron radiation sources — bending magnets, wigglers and undulators — are analyzed using this formalism.},

Such figure of merit was originally introduced in the SR community by Kim. The brightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometrical optics limit, can be interpreted as maximum density of photon flux in phase space. For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the WD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with a finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of a single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons in phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and electron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction angle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are intermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam divergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach is still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once more the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate regimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations and the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. We extend the WD formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a bending magnet. We find that in the intermediate regimes the usually accepted approximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent even parametrically.},

We show that the theory of laser beams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any SR source. Both radiation beam generated by an ultra-relativistic electron in a magnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based on paraxial approximation. It follows that they are similar in all aspects. In the space–frequency domain SR beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extents are large compared with the wavelength. In practical situations (e.g. undulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual “waist” where the wavefront is often plane. Remarkably, the field distribution of a SR beam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse Fourier transform of the far-field angle distribution. Then, we take advantage of standard Fourier Optics techniques and apply the Fresnel propagation formula to characterize the SR beam. Altogether, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the near-field distribution of the SR beam outside the magnetic setup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. The general theory of SR in the near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases of undulator radiation. Using known analytical formulas for the far-field pattern and its inverse Fourier transform we find analytical expressions for near-field distributions in terms of far-field distributions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the image formation problem for undulator radiation through an optical system, accounting for the influence of the electron beam emittance. On the one hand, image formation with Synchrotron Radiation is governed by the laws of Statistical Optics. On the other hand, the widely used Gaussian-Shell model cannot be applied to describe the coherence properties of X-ray beams from third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required. We propose a technique to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source, that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system. At first we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non-limiting pupil aperture. Our theory, which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, also allows treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their applicability region. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, which is relevant for third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. First principle calculations of undulator radiation characteristics (i.e. ten-dimensional integrals) are then reduced to one-dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions specific for undulator radiation sources. We also consider the imaging problem for a non-ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture, which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three. In particular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observation plane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and the intensity from an ideal lens.},

Current estimations of coherence properties often assume that undulator sources are quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem for calculating the degree of transverse coherence. Such assumption is not adequate when treating third generation light sources, because the vertical (geometrical) emittance of the electron beam is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength in a very wide spectral interval that spans over four orders of magnitude (from 0.1 up to 103Å). Sometimes, the so-called Gaussian–Schell model, that is widely used in statistical optics in the description of partially coherent sources, is applied as an alternative to the quasi-homogeneous model. However, as we will demonstrate, this model fails to properly describe coherent properties of X-ray beams from non-homogeneous undulator sources. As a result, a more rigorous analysis is required. We propose a technique, based on statistical optics and Fourier optics, to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator source in the most general case, at any position after the undulator. Our theory, that makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, allows relatively easy treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space, together with their region of applicability. Particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength, and the vertical emittance is arbitrary. This case is practically relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources.},

The SXN beamline intends to provide high flux and high spatial resolution coherent soft X-ray imaging capabilities using both zone plate and lensless coherent imaging techniques. The ARI beamline aims to perform high flux ARPES and RIXS experiments with a focal spot size at the sample approaching 100 nm using highly-demagnifying mirrors in Kirkpatrick-Baez geometry. To accurately calculate the resolution and the degree of X-ray coherence provided by the two state-of-the-art beamlines, partial coherence effects are required to be taken into account in wave optics simulations for these two beamlines. In this talk, beamline performance parameters such as spot size, degree of coherence, flux, and energy resolution at the sample are presented. The effects of mirror surface slope errors on beamline performance were studied and some suggestions for further optimization are discussed.},

With the absence of the quadratic phase terms, the required sampling density of the electric fields is effectively reduced. The problem size is thus moderate and the method is feasible to be implemented on a single-node CPU server. In other cases, the same argument holds with proper treatments of the quadratic phase terms. Tests on CMD and the modes propagation are done for the case of the Coherent Hard X-ray beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II, using the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop software.

We present a compact representation of the beam line map involving linear transformations and convolutions. We create a 1∶1 imaging system with a single slit on the image plane and observe the radiation downstream to it. We propagate a Gaussian beam and undulator radiation down this sample beam line, drawing parameters from current and future ultra low emittance light sources. We derive an analytic expression for the partially coherent Gaussian case including passage through a single slit aperture.

	abstract = {One of the most common and important tasks in wave optics simulation is choosing what mesh spacings and mesh dimensions to use for a given problem. To obtain correct results, it is crucial that the mesh spacings are sufficiently small and the mesh dimensions sufficiently large, but if one makes the spacings too small, or the dimensions too large, that can greatly increase the simulation run time, and that may be unaffordable. It is therefore important to understand exactly what the applicable constraints are, so that one may choose mesh spacings and dimensions that will yield correct results without being over-conservative. However this problem can be nontrivial, especially when modeling propagation through aberrating media, or when there is potentially useful a priori information available which might allow us to relax the modeling constraints. For example, if the light source is known to be well-collimated, we know that all of the light to be modeled will be concentrated along one axis, allowing us to use smaller meshes than we would if the light were uncollimated. Similarly, if the receiver has a limited field of view, we need not model any light incident upon it from angles outside its field of view. In this paper we present a simple general method to determine what mesh spacings and dimensions will work for any given wave optics propagation problem, including problems involving propagation through aberrating media and/or a priori information about the source and/or receiver.},

Using a parallel computing cluster with in excess of 500 cores and each core calculating the wavefront from in excess of a 1000 electrons, a source containing millions of electrons could be simulated. We have applied this method to the Diamond X-ray Imaging and Coherence beamline (113).},

	abstract = {Partially-coherent wavefront propagation calculations have proven to be feasible and very beneficial in the design of beamlines for 3rd and 4th generation Synchrotron Radiation (SR) sources. These types of calculations use the framework of classical electrodynamics for the description, on the same accuracy level, of the emission by relativistic electrons moving in magnetic fields of accelerators, and the propagation of the emitted radiation wavefronts through beamline optical elements. This enables accurate prediction of performance characteristics for beamlines exploiting high SR brightness and/or high spectral flux. Detailed analysis of radiation degree of coherence, offered by the partially-coherent wavefront propagation method, is of paramount importance for modern storage-ring based SR sources, which, thanks to extremely small sub-nanometer-level electron beam emittances, produce substantial portions of coherent flux in X-ray spectral range. We describe the general approach to partially-coherent SR wavefront propagation simulations and present examples of such simulations performed using "Synchrotron Radiation Workshop" (SRW) code for the parameters of hard X-ray undulator based beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven National Laboratory. These examples illustrate general characteristics of partially-coherent undulator radiation beams in low-emittance SR sources, and demonstrate advantages of applying high-accuracy physical-optics simulations to the optimization and performance prediction of X-ray optical beamlines in these new sources.},

	abstract = {Ultra-low emittance third-generation synchrotron radiation (SR) sources, such as NSLS-II and MAX-IV, will offer excellent opportunities for further development of experimental techniques exploiting X-ray coherence. However, even in these new SR sources, the radiation produced by relativistic electrons (in undulators, wigglers and bending magnets) will remain only partially coherent in the X-ray spectral range. “Extraction” of “coherent portion” of the radiation flux and its transport to sample without loss of coherence must be performed by dedicated SR beamlines, optimized for particular types of experiments. Detailed quantitative prediction of partially coherent X-ray beam properties at propagation through optical elements, which is required for the optimization of such beamlines, can only be obtained from accurate and efficient physical-optics based numerical simulations. Examples of such simulations, made for NSLS-II beamlines, using “Synchrotron Radiation Workshop” (SRW) computer code, are presented. Special attention is paid to the numerical analysis of the basic properties of partially coherent undulator radiation beam and its distinctions from the Gaussian beam. Performance characteristics of importance for particular beamlines, such as radiation spot size and flux at sample vs size of secondary source aperture for high-resolution microscopy beamlines, are predicted by the simulations.},
